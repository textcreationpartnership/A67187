            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome years agoe my friends prevailed with me to take in hand the tranſlating out of the <hi>German</hi> Tongue into the <hi>Belgick</hi> ſtile, this preſent Book of that moſt famous and well expert Surgeon <hi>Felix Wurtz,</hi> Citie Surgeon at <hi>Baſell:</hi> I undertook it, and having done the moity of it, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable obſtruction fell in, whereby the work was left, by another to be finiſhed; who as much as he was able to do took it in hand, to further the publick good: but being not ſo well expert in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, ſome of the Simples were not well tranſlated. Theſe Copies being ſpent for the moſt part, and ſince that Book was at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraltimes new printed, with augmentation and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: thereupon I thought it good, to undertake the ſecond tranſlation into the <hi>Belgick</hi> ſtile; in reſpect of the great utilitte of it, how neceſſary it would be for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young men and Novices in that profeſsion, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Apprentiſes to good Maſters, undertake to cure ſuch and ſuch accidents as may come into their hands, which they hardly underſtand any thing of; ſuch young men muſt put their greateſt confidence to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall doctrines and inſtructions of expert and good Authors, among which this (though but ſmall) ought to have not the loweſt place, being well expert in his wayes, plain in his doctrinals, and proſperous in his manualls, perfect in his preparations, and correct in their uſe. All theſe in my judgement, will be very
<pb facs="tcp:106818:5"/> uſefull to Novices and others in Surgery; the Book is but little, of no great price, eaſily uſed; the medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet down in it, though they are not coſtly, yet they are approved. From thence as well Maſters, as Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may draw many uſeful good and ſubtile inſtructions, and perform many cures on pained and tormented hearts. In conſideration whereof, I took in hand this preſent tranſlation out of the laſt Copy, which by reaſon of its ſpecial utilitie, was reprinted then the 28th time in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, and by the Author peruſed, augmented and corrected, whoſe practicall wayes I have followed theſe nineteen years, and ſucceſsfully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many good and notable cures through Gods bleſsing. For I declare upon experience, that one time through means of his Fracture Plaiſters (next unto God) I preſerved a young mans life, whoſe right legg was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his ſhin bone ſtuck in ſand half a fingers length being at Sea ten weeks, enduring all manner of tempeſtuous weathers, ſet him upon his legg, though ſomewhat ſhorter; his Sea buſineſs made him ſtir his legg too much, putting the Fracture to a wider gape, which occaſioned that the Fracture could not ſo well be kept together, beſides the wound requiring every day a ſecond dreſsing: the marrow did run ſo faſt, that the maggats without the wound next to the band grew on, which I killed with the black Ointment, and kept them out of the wound, notwithſtanding we were then in a very hot climate in the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider how pleaſant his Manuals are in Head and Eye wounds, and their accidental difficulties. How neatly he deſcribeth the wounds of the breaſt and belly, and the cures thereof. Take good notice of the uſe of his band and dreſsing of a Fracture, which are of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts; what notable examples he quoteth of ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:106818:5"/> cures? How lively he deſcribeth the ſeveral Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and their cure? What ſhall I ſay more? Doth he not write of the ſeveral ſignes and fore-runners of all accidentall difficulties, which may be incident unto all ſorts of wounds? In brief, he is an extraordinary good and uſefull Author, in my judgement, eſpecially for young beginners in Surgerie, comprehending ſo many things in ſuch a ſmall volum; nothing derogating from other good Authors. For he teacheth ſo lively, and handleth the ſeveral Simptomes ſo well, as ever I ſaw in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, well underſtanding the things he writeth and maketh relation of. Conſidering theſe things, it was a motive unto me, to ſet it over into our <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue for the publick good, to the end, that thoſe which do not underſtand the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, may have it in their mother Tongue to make the beſt uſe of it. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat all thoſe, into whoſe hands this work cometh, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Tranſlators good will, and in caſe ſome Hearbs and Simples are found untranſlated, which will be but very few, let the Courteous Reader underſtand, that theſe Smples are left ſo, becauſe in <hi>Germanie</hi> they call them in one Province by ſuch a name, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Land they have other names for them: herein the Reader may have good help out of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Herball; and this I am certain of, that I uſed but few names of the <hi>Germans.</hi> Thus I recommend to the courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this my labour, and my ſelf into his favour, praying withall that thoſe who know better, would be pleaſed to do better.</p>

               <hi>Glandorfius</hi> and others mention him with honourable reſpects;
<pb facs="tcp:106818:6"/> nor can I conceave if his method had been vulgar and common, the <hi>Germans</hi> would ever have printed him eight and twenty times in his own Language, and twice in the <hi>Belgick.</hi> I preſume the Epiſtle Dedicatory, and Epistle to the Reader prefixed, ſpeak ſo liberally in my Authors commendation, that though I were ſilent, he need no greater applauſe then the general fame of his worth to ſet him forth to the world, who hath ſo much admired him.</p>
            <p>Other Nations have made ſuch honourable mention of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe at <hi>Baſell,</hi> with ſuch happy ſucceſſes, that I could not ſo much undervalue his worth, as to conceale and eclipſe him, from our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Character and knowledge. Therefore now having (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the importunitie of ſome friends) preſented him to publick view, not binding him up under the protection of one Man, but giving him free leave to ſojourn all the Nation over, that he may do the moſt good he can, not in the leaſt queſtioning, but that he it able to make good ſhift for himſelf, in the greateſt difficulty, though but a ſtranger in this Land; for I do not in the leaſt think, but that he will meet with very many Carpers and Cavilers, may be ſome upon this account, becauſe he is not Dedicated to ſome learned <hi>Engliſh Doctor;</hi> but let them know, that when he was in his native Countrie, he had a worthy Defender, the fame of whom, (though he be dead) ſtill is able to protect him from ſcandalous and reproachful ſpeeches. Now as for the judicious and underſtanding Reader, to whom eſpecially I preſent him, I humbly deſire him, to conſider the frailty of Mans nature, that if he find any thing, either not perfectly Tranſlated, or miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, loveingly to amend it with his pen, and defend its cauſe therein; and ſtill to aſcribe that which is good in him, to the Praiſe and Glory of God: in the doing of which, he will very much oblige his friend, and ſervant in the like caſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD Almighty having Created man, among other gifts, he beſtowed alſo on him a Knowledge of good and profitable Arts, wherein he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly furniſhed, if ſo be, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that ſtate, in which the Lord at firſt had created him; but not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and being miſſed by the Devil, falling into ſin, then he loſt thoſe good endowments alſo, wherewith he at firſt was adorned; and fell from the light of Knowledge into a darkneſs of ignorance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was put to it, with great paines and induſtry to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call them to his mind again, and in part to recover that, which formerly he had been endewed withall: and we ſee, that men naturally are thus qualified, that they are able
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106818:12"/> either to ſpeak, or to practiſe one Skill or other, be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree thereof what it will, as we ſee in Muſical, Arithmetical, and other Arts. That the like was happened alſo unto Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, is no queſtion. For though a phyſical Skill had been needleſs, if man had not ſinned; yet is it certain, that all things, which God had from the beginning created to be medicinal, were more effectual and operative, then they are now adayes, the which doubtleſs was well known unto man: but having loſt this Knowledge through ſinning, and there being a neceſſity of a phyſical Knowledge, by reaſon of the multiplicity of infirmities he made himſelf ſubject unto by ſin, then he began to look for that, he loſt, as much as lay in his power, knowing and finding in himſelf, by the help of that little ſpark which he had left to him of the firſt Light, that ſuch infirmities and diſeaſes might be prevented by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. Hence we obſerve, that few men are found, which do not know either how to help or how to adviſe in time of ſickneſs, be it in any kind. Being it is ſo, as I hope none will gain-ſay it, it enforced me to write ſomewhat of Surgery, for the benefit of the Novices in Surgery. I ſhould at firſt ſpeak of the meaner and ſlighter Wounds, which being known for the moſt part how they may be cured, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the practiſe thereof profeſſed; I hold it needleſs to write of them, and ſo I begin with higher matters.</p>
                  <p>Note therefore, my intention is not to treat of ſlight Wounds in this Book, when the skin onely is cut, which either Nature or an old Woman may cure; my purpoſe is to ſpeak of dangerous Wounds, in reſpect of the place, or of the blow, which are ſubject unto ſymptoms accordingly, as when not onely the skin is cut, but the fleſh, ſinews and arteries, and other things are hurt: ſlighter wounds are eaſily cured, but ſuch, whereby Nature is ſuppreſt, requires more skil, which by long experience is attained unto. Therefore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell not, why I do not mention at the beginning of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, how ſlight cuts and wounds may be cured, becauſe their cure is generally known and practiſed.</p>

                        <hi>How the abuſes did ariſe, and were brought forth among the Surgeons themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is free for every one to ſet down in writing that which he experimentally found, and to publiſh it for the benefit and information unto others, as a thing which concernes the publique good, and we ought to be beneficial unto our neighbours, and to warn him of dangers, as we would have done to our ſelves: which hath been a motive unto me to write of wounds, as I found it in my practiſe: And in the firſt place I advertiſe of the groſs and dangerous abuſes, which are committed at the curing of wounds (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of old ſores) to the greateſt prejudice and danger of poor Patients.</p>
                  <p>Doutleſs all expert Surgeons will acknowledge, that a Skill in Surgery is obtained with great painfulneſs; for it is not gotten with ſitting on a cuſhion at home (as many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) by reading and writing, but a long and induſtrious practiſe is required, if ſo be that men intend to be reall in it, unto which great travelling belongeth alſo.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he that ſtudies to get a name of credit herein, <note place="margin">How Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> muſt viſit in his travellings expert Surgeons, and to learn of them what they have ſeen in their practiſe, and to obſerve their Manuals, which are learned when they are ſeen done, and in that way committed to our truſt: and when we have been ocular witneſſes in their practiſe, then may we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do the like. It is not enough to be full of talks, and to ſay, ſuch and ſuch write ſo, and if theſe Writers ſhould be asked, from whence they had it, it may be, they will direct us either to a Nun in a Cloyſter, or to ſome old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from whom they had it, and in the upſhut it proveth meerly an accuſtomed thing, whereas Surgery ought to be grounded on a ſure ſcience, and not on an opinion. A Painter, what is he the better for it, if he can diſcourſe well of colours, and prateth much, how this or that ought to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106818:13"/> painted, when himſelf cannot hold a Pencel, and hath no skill to paint? his prating will give no content to him that would have a picture made by him: even ſo it is in Surgery, a Patient is little the better for it, if his Surgeon be meerly talkative, and hath no skill to dreſs, eaſe, or cure his wounds. From thence, in my judgement, ariſe all manner of faults, errors and abuſes in Surgery, when experimental Knowledge is wanting, when men are full of words, but empty in the practick part. For when Surgeons are all upon diſcourſes, and take their experience from thence, needs muſt they be faulty in their undertakings, relying onely upon their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; what is the Patient the better for it, if Medicines are not aptly and duly applied.</p>
                  <p>We are to note how theſe abuſes creep in: whence fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ſtart-ups, that have cured the Scabs, Morphew, or ſuch <note place="margin">Of Poach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Quacks.</note> like, then are they cryed up for Surgeons, and when ſome hardly come out of their apprenticeſhip they alſo muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly profeſs Surgery, and if their Maſters have been Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant's, what can be expected from their Apprentices? if theſe do ſeek no further, but what they had from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which knew little enough, then we know what theſe may be confided in. And thus they play on upon the old Fiddle the old tune continually: yea, it happeneth, that the old things are counted beſt, and new ones, which are better, are rejected: old naughty things long practiſed are ſtill cried up, not conſidering, that naught will be naught, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good, though it had been practiſed a thouſand years, but rather will prove worſe.</p>

Let the Reader not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with my ſtile, much differing from other Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Surgery, whoſe artificial deſcription of Cures, with their ſecret myſteries, are not unknown unto me, having judged them long agoe to be foul, uſeleſs and naught, and never defiled my hands with them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all I begin with ſtitching, where ſeveral abuſes are found, cauſing intolerable dangers.</p>
                  <p>Touching ſtitching, it is to be noted, that I neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn nor diſprove this or that meanes, which ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter, which are of good uſe, if ſeaſonably and in a due meaſure uſed and applied: but if neither in ſeaſon nor meaſure they are made uſe of, then are they not onely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but very hurtful alſo. My meaning is not, that becauſe things are abuſed their lawful uſe ſhould be taken away alſo. My aſſertion is, that ſtitching doth good, and is of good uſe, if time, place and other circumſtances are exactly obſerved: but if uſed indiſcreetly, not regarding of the circumſtances, then is it not onely uſeleſs, but very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Stitching is granted and permitted, and is of ſingular <note place="margin">Where ſtitching is permitted.</note> utility, not in all places, nor in any wound, but onely when and where there is a neceſſity of it.

                  <p>℞ Gum Tragacanth and Arabick, Maſtick, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Sarcocolle, <hi>ana.</hi> one drachm.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106818:14"/>
                  <p> Mingle theſe, reduce it to a ſubtile powder, take the white of an Egg, beat it with a ſpoon to a froth, let the froth ſettle to water, imbibe the powder with it, with this Ointment ſpread your linnen, with ſtitching may be thus performed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: diſſolve the brown ointment, put it into wounds in ſuch places, where it conveniently may get in, then ſtitch it cloſer, the ſtitches muſt be two fingers breadth aſunder: in joynt-wounds the ſtitches muſt not be ſo cloſe together; in caſe the wound be above the ſhoulder, or above the knee, then two cloſe ſtitches may be made, that the one may keep and hold up the other, otherwiſe each may tear out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two ſtitches there muſt be left an open place, to put tents in, to cleanſe away the matter and moiſture. Note further, touching wounds upon joynts, that theſe wounds muſt be with double ſilk ſtrongly ſtitch'd, more than other wounds uſually are, elſe they break and tear out: if you ſtitch a wound on the ſhoulder as you do one on the belly, that ſtitch will not hold one day or night.</p>
                  <p>Touching other wounds and ſtabs (few excepted, be they what they will) there ſtitching is not onely not good, but extreamly hurtful, and cauſeth a great deal of miſery and pain, which muſt be avoided if you will be upright in your dealing.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of abuſes, I know it very well, that ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of common uſe, and ſo common as any thing is in Surgery, and uſed almoſt by all: (I ſay almoſt, becauſe ſome there are found, which know not what belongs to ſtitching.) Beſides this good cuſtome, this additional came unto, that they ſet upon the ſeveral ſtitchings ſeveral prices, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome prevailed ſo much, that ſome Surgeons preſs it to the utmoſt, and ſtand upon it, not regarding the hurts and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cauſed thereby, and poor people durſt not ſay one word againſt their demands. Therefore let me talk a little with ſuch, which ſtiffely would have all kind of wounds ſtitch'd (though they underſtand little or nothing of it) to make known their ignorance, not to that end, as to diſgrace their profeſſion and skill.</p>
                  <p>True, I am not ignorant of, that ſtitching hath been <note place="margin">Stitching is uſed of old.</note>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106818:14"/> commonly practiſed and uſed, and that it is of an antient uſe and cuſtome, but I do not ſay, that it is ere the better for it; for things antient, things common, are not therefore the better, elſe many evill cuſtoms and abuſes muſt be approved of, which, as naught, are moſt juſtly rejected.</p>
                  <p>For any Surgeon muſt needs confeſs and agree with me, and it is undeniable, that wounds ought to be cured funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, not ſuperficially; for if wounds be cured out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and the inſide and bottom of it be ſtill unheal'd, as it often happeneth, what can enſue thereupon, but a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and incurable fiſtulâ, to ſay nothing of their inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences? Thus you ſee, that there is no reaſon at all, why any wound ſhould be firſt ſtitched together.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, that through ſtitching the lips of wounds are joyned orderly, which being neglected, the wounds gape wide aſunder, which with ſtitching muſt be prevented: I know it very well, that the lips of wounds are drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through ſtitching, and kept from gaping, but how wiſely it is done, and what good it doth, let men of underſtanding judge! For thoſe that do ſuch things, little do they think, that wounds ſtitched either do ſoon rot, or ſoon break out, and thereby the wound comes to its old gape and ſhape, yea, often groweth worſe than it was at firſt. Moreover, if ſo be, that the ſtitches keep long to the wound, then the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threed conſumeth in the fleſh, which cauſes worſe ſcarrs from the ſtitching than the wound it ſelf would, beſides that, the threed is obſtructive to the healing of the wound, ſliding up and down in it. Neither do theſe men once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which is the chiefeſt thing, that any wound (let it gape nere ſo wide) by a natural inclination and quality groweth cloſer every day more and more, and that from beneath upwards, and from within outwards, as much as every dayes healing comes to: and thus that inbred and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quality driveth on from the beginning to the end, ſo that the lips of wounds are found cloſed, and cauſe ſmaller cicatrices after healing, then ſtitching would have done. For a wound preſs'd and ſtitch'd together, that wound lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not onely a ſcarr behind, but alſo every ſtitch cauſeth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106818:15"/> one, which after healing ſheweth ghaſtly: if there be any dangerous wounds, the ſame may be helped with lints, whereby they may the ſooner and eaſier be cloſed. For good bindings are of great conſequence, as you ſhall hear hereafter. But ſtitching is wholly naught, except in ſome few wounds is it neceſſary, which partly were mentioned, and partly ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it is manifeſt and known, that wounds ought to be healed fundamentally, and by no meanes from above down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; therefore it followeth, that medicines muſt come to the bottom of wounds, where muſt be laid the beginning of their healing: and if a wound be ſtitched in the outſide, how can the ointment come to the bottom of the wound, where it ſhould firſt of all begin to work? Truly, if a door be ſhut, then they uſe to ſay, ſtay without till the door be opened again.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it happeneth upon that reaſon, that worms <note place="margin">Worms in wounds.</note> grow in wounds, cauſed by the matter in wounds, choak'd up there; for the wound being ſtitch'd, it was ſo obſtructive; <note place="margin">Their cauſe</note> ſo as that the medicine and ointment could not penetrate to the Wounds in moſt places, as Nature was deſirous it ſhould.</p>
                  <p>And when ſuch ſymptoms fall out, then they look out for all manner of remedies to deſtroy and to kill theſe worms, whereby the wound in its healing is not onely hindered, but is made alſo worſe and more dangerous, and poor Patients are thereby moſt miſerably tormented. Therefore ſuch Surgeons, which ſuffer worms to grow in wounds, deſerve to be puniſhed ſeverely and exemplary; the rather, becauſe ſuch miſchief might have been eaſily prevented, and that onely with common Sallade oil; much more could their growing be hindered with ſharp and bitter things.</p>
                  <p>Surgeons, God be thanked, may be had, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well enough how wounds ought to be cured, and that it muſt firſt of all be done from within, and the medicine <note place="margin">Medicines muſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the bottom.</note> applyed muſt penetrate to the bottom: and if wounds are ſtitch'd cloſe, how can they apply any medicine to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the wound, without putting the Patients to great pains? for they take tents, roul it in their balſoms or oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106818:15"/> and force them in betwixt the ſtitches to the bottom of the wound. Some, to mend the matter, inſtead of ſuch tents or lints (Mullipuffs) take groſſe ſtrong weeks, and thruſt them to the bottom of the wounds, and ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common ſaying, they afford the wheel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Gallows, to be executed withall. But what reaſon they have to do ſo, and whether it be available and good, let them anſwer. How doth it ſound, or ſtand with any reaſon, to ſtitch a wound together in the outſide, and to tear it aſunder afterward betwixt the ſtitches, with lints, or mullipuffs, tents or weeks? I ſay nothing of other miſcheifs, which are cauſed thereby, as truly underſtanding men may eaſily judge of it: and to ſay nothing of the extream pains, and grievous ſmartings, which are inflicted upon the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when their wounds are thus ſcoured, even as Muſquetieres are ſcouring their Muſquets after much ſhooting.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is well known, and cannot be denied, that <note place="margin">Wounds muſt be cleanſed.</note> every wound ought to be kept clean, and to be cleanſed from the filth, which the blow brought in, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs incident unto. Now if a wound be ſtitch'd, how is it poſſible to cleanſe it daily, as it ought, the ſtitches ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way, and are obſtructive to the cleanſing of them? And though they partly may be thus cleanſed, how can it be done without putting the Patient to cruell torments, which in conſcience ought not to be? For they muſt gripe, feel, ſound, thruſt, this and that way, and many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, which are required at ſuch cleanſings; whereby the healing is often hindered, and contractures and lameneſs <note place="margin">Stiching hinders healing, and cauſeth lameneſs.</note> are cauſed. Men ſhould conſider, that wounds cannot ſo ſoon and ſo well be healed by preſſing the matter out of them forcibly, as then when the matter comes forth freely without any let, through Natures driving it forth out of wounds.</p>
                  <p>Things hitherto ſpoken do not ſuffice, more muſt be ſaid <note place="margin">Stiching hinders the ſwellings of wounds to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</note> yet, which ſerve to our purpoſe very much, touching ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wounds, it is generally known, and plain, that all wounds, be they what they will, are of that condition, that they will ſwell a little, and naturally extrude their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106818:16"/> and matter. Seeing it is ſo, and none can gain-ſay it, therefore the judicious may eaſily conceive, that if a wound of its own accord is ſwell'd, the door or lip of it is thicker than at other times, and ſo generally wounds always ſtrive to gape. And if in that poſture they be ſtitched, as their uſuall way is, then is that wound in that natural ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hindered, and ſo cannot enlarge it ſelf, as it ſhould. Then it begins to ſpawn and ſwell, whereby nothing elſe is cauſed, but an inflammation of the wound, to the greateſt miſery and unſpeakable pain of the Patient, which this raſh and intolerable ſtitching hath cauſed, againſt which there is no remedy, till that anger in the wound be paſt, and the wound caſt out its matter. Now when the ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath overcome this Surgeons skill, I ſhould have ſaid, his abuſe, and other ſymptoms (which ſtruggling is no ſporting to the poor Patient, becauſe his skin lieth at the ſtake) then the wound inclineth to a reſt, and fitteth it ſelf to healing. But it happeneth many times, that the wounds preſſe hard with the ſtitching, inſomuch that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they burſt and break, whereby the wound is made bigger, wider and more dangerous than ever it was before. I pray to what end were the ſtitchings uſed, but to torment the poor patient the more? Theſe and the former things are noted to that end, that it may appear to every ones eye, that a ſtitch'd wound doth not heal ſo well as thoſe which are not ſtitch'd and left free, for reaſons mentioned above, needleſs to be repeated here.</p>
                  <p>Moreover (which is the chiefeſt) this muſt needs be granted, and in no way contradicted, that the ſigns of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals <note place="margin">Stitching hinders the judging of Symptoms.</note> in wounds are chiefly judged and diſcerned from the bottom of wounds. Now if a wound be ſtitch'd, how is it poſſible, that ſymptoms of wounds can be diſcerned and judged rightly, when they may not be viewed within? This maketh me wonder the leſſe, why ſo few Surgeons are found, that have any judgement in ſymptoms of wounds. When the wounds are quite healed, then are they puzzled, not knowing what excuſe to make, not knowing the cauſe, why ſwellings and other ſymptoms remain, nor how to cure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106818:16"/> thoſe which they had healed, dawb'd up, and choak'd up. Then they fall to waſhing, bathing, annointing, ſalving, binding and the like, whereby they ſuppoſe to remedy and to expell all theſe ſymptoms, which themſelves have cauſed: why could they not conſider of it afore, whileſt the wound was open, and could then ſee it plainly, what will they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake now, when the wound is ſhut?</p>
                  <p>Note one thing more, which I had almoſt forgotten; it <note place="margin">Sinnews are taken hold of by ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> happens ſometimes, that one being wounded in the hand, or elſe-where, where there is little fleſh, and many white veines and arteries: if a Surgeon, that will hear of nothing but of ſtitching, hath it in hand, how ſoon is it done, that he thruſteth the needle through a ſinnew or blood vein, puls the threed through it, and ſo ſtitches them altogether? I tell you truly, that through this raſhneſs and indiſcreetneſs moſt dangerous and worſt ſymptoms are cauſed, that ever may be imagined. For how can the blood-vein be ſtench'd, when a threed is thruſt thorough, and how can the anger of the ſinews be allayed, when the threed is drawn through it? It happeneth many times, that through this needleſs ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſinews, is cauſed the running of ſinews, and how can they come at it to ſtop it?</p>
                  <p>It is beyond expreſſion and beleif, what great dangers are cauſed with ſuch unneceſſary ſtitchings: I could quote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples to that purpoſe, if it were needful, how by theſe abuſes Patients were brought to extream miſeries, and to the loſſe of their lives, who might have done well enough without this ſtitching, being in no danger of life at all.</p>
                  <p>Thus much be ſpoken of ſtitching in general and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; when I come to the practick part, perhaps I ſhall ſpeak more largely, and make every thing more plain to the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Now follow ſome neceſſary obſervations touching ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and wounds, which are worthy to be diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Charge not the wound with too much ſtitching, have a care of the evenneſs in ſtitching, make not crooked ſtitches, take hold enough, elſe it teares out, and the wound groweth ghaſtly; do not begin to ſtitch at the end of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106818:17"/> wound, but juſt in the middle: begin with that lip firſt, which is the fitter of the two: ſtitch none of the looſe pieces of fleſh, they will aſſimilate no more: Let the wound have air above, thereby to put in the ointment, and leave open below, that the matter may get out: bind the wound not too hard, elſe it will ſwell, be the wound on the hands, feet, or any other member: the wounded members muſt be laid even, not ſhelving or downwards, elſe that member will ſwell: and your bindings muſt not be too ſlack, that no air may get in betwixt the bands: let the party be quiet, and neglect him not in dreſſing, elſe the bands will ſtink and rot; let the bands be not hot, elſe an Impoſthume will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall that member, and be not over haſty in your binding, elſe cramps will be cauſed, or a conſumption may be incident to that member. Stop not the wounds with weeks and ſuch like, that the matter ſwell not, and below the wound holes be cauſed, which uſually turn to fiſtulaes. Be not ſparing in your ſalve and ointment at firſt; and let not the ointments quantity exceed the matters, which otherwiſe overtopping the ointment, would make it of no effect. Have a care, that the ſtitches break not, elſe they will cauſe ſcarrs, but ſupply them with ſtitching-plaiſters.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BLood-ſtenching in Surgery is a very neceſſary point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch <note place="margin">Stenching of blood is neceſſary.</note> that without it little is effected. For Patients looſe their lives if they bleed too much; neither are the medicaments effectual, if by a continual running of blood they be hindered in their operation: and where there is a neceſſity of blood-ſtenching, there it ought to be uſed and applyed according to Art. And, God be thanked, Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are found, which have reaſonable judgement in it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106818:17"/> and know how to ſtench blood, and uſe it without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, but rather to the great benefit of their Patients.</p>
                  <p>But the ruder ſort goes to work baſely, whoſe number alwayes overtops the better ſort, and refuſe better inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">Blood-ſtenching abuſed.</note> keeping and ſticking to their old wayes, obſtinately obſerving their abuſes, even as when they intended nothing elſe but the ruine of their Patients: I ſpeak of ſuch onely, which uſe Corroſives, ſuppoſing the ſtenching of blood muſt be effected onely with nealed Irons and other burning meanes; among others, they uſe ſublimed Mercury, crude or ſublimed Arſenick, calcined Vitriol, <hi>Alumen Plumoſum, Caput mort</hi> of <hi>Aqua fort, Euphorbium,</hi> and ſuch like things, whereby they ſuppoſe to ſtench the blood: Some there are found, which, to mend the matter, take one or two of the mentioned things, put them together, and mingle other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments among it, as <hi>Bole Armoniack, Terra ſigillata,</hi> Millers duſt, <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and ſuch like. This they hold for a rare Secret and Maſter-piece, calling it, a ſharp Blood-ſtenching, not without a cauſe, for it is ſharp enough, nay too ſharp.</p>
                  <p>It is a great pitty, that theſe and ſuch like things muſt be <note place="margin">Abuſes condemned.</note> cried up for rarities and maſter-pieces, whereas they are nothing elſe but heavy and dangerous abuſes and errors, whereby infinite wrongs are done. For all thoſe above mentioned things, one or more of them being uſed to a freſh wound, for to ſtench the blood withall, effect or do little or no good at all, which were tollerable yet, but they cauſe thereby infinite wrongs, and do no leſſe therewith, as if they had ſtrayed the wounds full of venom.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, I pray, if a wound bleedeth vehemently, and you will ſtench it with one of the above named materials or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives, when you ſtray that pouder into, doth the wound ceaſe to bleed preſently? Whoever affirms it, I deny it: For theſe materials in and outſide I know very well, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, whither they have any efficacy in them to ſtench blood preſently, yea, or no? Muſt not the Wound, being ſtraid full, be bound up, with cotton Wool, plaiſters and the like, that the blood may not iſſue forth? Now vvhen you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106818:18"/> have thus bound up the wound, and ſtench'd the blood, ſo that it can run out no more, could you not procure alſo that the in-ſtrayed pouder ſhould not work in the wound, and that the corroſive, which pulleth the running veins toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot effect that, becauſe the running blood driveth it back, and waſheth it away? For if a wound be carefully bound, ſo that no blood can run out, then of neceſſity the blood is ſtench'd, and congealeth in the Wound. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, then the corroſive incorporates with it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins then to work, that is to ſay, to rage, to eat and to burn.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know here, of what uſe Corroſives are in <note place="margin">Corroſives are hurtful extreamly.</note> blood ſtenching, as long as the blood congealeth without ſuch fretting things, and may be ſtayed onely by a careful binding of the Wound? Perhaps you think the Patient is not ſufficiently tormented, unleſs you put more affliction and plagues upon him: you immagine the Patient is not weak enough, and ſo with your ſharp Corroſives you muſt make him a Martyr. Ah how many veins! ah! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinews, which are not hurt at all by the blow, nor toucht, are eaten through by your ſharp corroſiive blood-ſtenchers, and are forcibly torn in pieces, or at leaſt benummed or mortified, which would not have been ſo, if you had not medled with them. Are not lameneſſes cauſed thereby, and much wrong and evill inflicted upon Patients, whoſe Wounds might have been eaſily cured, if they had been dealt honeſtly withall</p>
                  <p>I knew one, who profeſſed Surgery, he was to ſtench a <note place="margin">Example of one whoſe blood was ſtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> bleeding wound: He took his pouder (of the which he boaſted much) thruſt the pouder into the Wound with ſome cotten wooll, bound it up, ſuppoſing he had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at it: a little while after the Patient cried out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, complaining of his paines, by reaſon of the raging and burning he felt in the Wound. I asked the ſaid Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what he had put into the Patients Wound? He was loath to reveal it, becauſe he held it for a great Secret and Maſter-piece: however upon my importuning he ſaid, it was calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Vitriol, and <hi>Gummi Euphorbium,</hi> ſublimed Mercury,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106818:18"/> mingled with <hi>Bole</hi> and <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> and a little quantity of Vinegar among it, which he called quenching. This was his great Skill and Secret, wherewith he uſually bound up Wounds. But what happened? He did more hurt then a wound twice as big would have done. For though this mans Wound was not ſuch, where a lameneſs might be feared, yet was he made a Cripple, becauſe this corroſive pouder hath corroded and eaten off his ſinnews, which were not hurt at all: I pray what ſimpathy have theſe ſaid ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples one with the other; eſpecially <hi>Terra ſigillata, Gummi Euphorbium?</hi> In like manner many Receipts are ſcrewed together with a company of ſimples, which do fit as much, as a piece of new cloth a Beggar-patch'd coat of ſeverall ſorts of old rags; all this is no ſport or paſtime to the poor Patient, whoſe skin muſt reach for it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe abuſes hitherto ſhewed, about blood ſtenching, are great and groſſe ones, whereby incurable hurts are cauſed; <note place="margin">Abuſe of hot Irons in blood-ſtenching, which cauſe great hurt, A horrible Skill.</note> and yet are they not comparable unto thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with hot Irons, whereby the Patients wounded veins, ſinews and other parts are drawn and ſhrunk together, and haled, as if pulled by a horſe. And this is held a great Skill amongſt many; but it is, in my opinion, ſuch a terrible Skill, which meerly belongeth to murthers, and I am eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Hangmen have taught this way at firſt: Others, that will outſtrip their fellows in their Skill, take cotten wool, thruſt it lighted into the Wound, whereby they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have done well for the good of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>But as I have ſaid in general, that I reject nor condemn blood ſtenching, but rather hold it neceſſary and allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as occaſion ſerveth: neither do I wholly condemn hot Irons to ſtench bloud withal, and hold it to be of very good uſe in Surgery, as at the off-cutting of a member, at the thickeſt part in the thigh, and in two or three places more; as when an Excreſcence is to be cut off, or other things, well known to judicious Surgeons. But that it ſhould be of any uſe in wounds, there I deny it abſolutely, and am fully perſwaded, that nothing but miſery thereby is cauſed, For as ſoon as the little white veines feel the heat of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106818:19"/> fire, they ſhrink preſently, grow ſhorter, and may never be brought to their former length; all judicious Surgeons muſt confeſs ſo much. Unto which miſery this is incident alſo, or rather will enſue thereupon, that a Wound thus burnt will never heal ſo ſoon and ſo well as thoſe will, which never had ſuch things ſupplied, the reaſon of it is known to many. And ah! how many Wounds are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inflamed, and the parties lame, when doubtleſs they might have done better.</p>
                  <p>In my youthful dayes I have been an eye witneſs, how one received a Wound about his temple of four fingers <note place="margin">Example.</note> breadth; oh! how was this poor man tortured with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives, with lighted cotten Wooll, with nealed Iron, and the like, being thruſt into his Wound, and all to no purpoſe; for the bleeding of it could not be quenched. All theſe Surgeons being in a deſpair about their Patient, whom they thus unmercifully tormented, not knowing what to do any further in this caſe, they wiſh'd the Patient to commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God Almighty, which however ought to be done without their grave adviſe: when all their applied meanes would neither take nor work, there came forth an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, laid ſome kind of haires on a leather, and laid into the Wound a piece of lint or quilt, and then ſhe applied her plaiſter: it ſtenched the blood, and the Party was healed: was not this old Woman more skilful, and ſurer in her Art, than all theſe Surgeons, Barbers, Doctors, that were then preſent? My ſelf at that time being very young, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced, was aſhamed for their ſake, though I had very little judgement, that they profeſſing that Art had ſo little judgement in it.</p>
                  <p>Some ſixteen yeares ago there was a young man at <hi>B.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sharp oil of Marcaſts is ſaid to ſtanch bleeding.</note> which received hurt in his buttocks, which did bleed very much, which a Barber-Surgeon could not ſtench with his ſharp bloud-ſtencher, which in that place was held a Maſter-piece to ſtench it: What do you think this Barber-Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had done? He took that biting oil of Antimony, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Sublimed Mercury, dipt cotten Wool in it, thruſt it to the Wounds bottom, this was ſuch a rarity and ſecret
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106818:19"/> skill, that this young man out-breathed his laſt within few houres after, for it moſt miſerably tormented him, who might have been very well ſaved, if this Barber had not medled with him.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould rehearſe all what miſeries I have ſeen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">Intolerable miſeries cauſed by burning.</note> by burning of wounds, that did bleed, though I have ſeen but little, and have but ſmall experience, yet time would fall ſhort with me, to rehearſe all, and it would prove tedious unto the Reader, to hear and read ſuch a long tale: beſides, I ſhould but pull an old houſe about my eares, if I ſhould put them to the publick view; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome antient Surgeons find ſome of the above named blood ſtenchings very neceſſary. Therefore I let it reſt, hoping that judicious Surgeons will take my writing in good part, and gather from thence, that among the Antients there was great ignorance by miſunderſtanding, as well as there is now adayes, or rather more.</p>
                  <p>To prevent theſe abuſes, in my judgement there is nothing better to be uſed in blood ſtenching, then quilts, lints, or mulli puffs, cotten Wool, or the like.</p>
                  <p>As for example, if a Wound bleedeth, and the cauſe of it is unknown, then do not feel, nor ſtir in the Wound, nor apply any ointment, but onely uſe a plaiſter, but in caſe the bleeding would not ceaſe, then ſuch ſaid things may be uſed, or any other fitting thing: but if the Wound doth bleed but little, in time when the Patient either walketh or ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, then bind it gently, and apply the plaiſter, where it bleedeth, then you may ſooneſt know from whence the blood cometh, and if there be any looſe or ſhatterd piece in it, which cauſeth the bleeding; being bound ſlack, it caſts up a ball or ſoft fleſh like coam'd wool, let it be gently preſs'd in again, it is a ſure token, that there is a ſhatterd piece in it, which is not altogether looſe, yet ſtriveth to come forth, where lieth a blood-vein, which that looſe piece doth hurt when ſtirred. Now ſuch like things being at hand, no haſte at all muſt be made with, nor ſearch made into the Wound; for that ſearch would put the Surgeon and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent upon more work, and increaſe the bleeding; and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106818:20"/> vein, being deeply hid, out of ſight, and no coming unto it: would produce new troubles. Therefore onely burnt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom very ſubtilly pulveriſed clapped in and upon, which is ſtrong enough for it, for if ſtronger or ſharper things ſhould be uſed, they would through-run the Wound, inſomuch that the cure would be delayed where it had been almoſt performed. That Allum muſt be let alone, till it drops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or comes off by melting, and in caſe it ſhould not come out the next day, then ſtray more Allum upon it, then it will ſoon take away that fleſh which hangeth on that ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but in caſe that ſplinter ſhould follow alſo, and the fleſh about it all conſumed, then that ſplinter hangeth yet on a panick, which muſt come out alſo. However proceed in the healing, as if there were no ſuch ſplinter therein, it will looſen of its own accord, the healing will put that aſide, even as an old tooth muſt give way to a young one, even ſo the new fleſh driveth out that piece at the wound eaſily, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it may be taken away without danger. Search not with any Iron or Silver Inſtruments into the Wound, for if you touch any bone or criſle, eſpecially in ſuch members that are full of them, then that joynt will never take any fleſh. I give warning to all, I have found it ſo, deſire no more to ſearch: it is a common ſaying amongſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are more ſuch looſe pieces in the Wound, they will have them all out, and feel and ſearch in the Wound like a blind man. It is a great fooliſhneſs, to feel, and groap about Wounds, touch them with hard fingers without, and ſearch their inſide with Inſtruments, You Novices in Surgery, when three, five, or more are called together to ſuch a Patient, ſuffer not the Patients Wound ſo rudely to be toucht, for I ſpeak by knowledge, and not out of other mens opinions, and know what hurt is done thereby.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving begun to treat of blood ſtenching, I could not <note place="margin">Abuſes in Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> chuſe but to declare ſome abuſes committed by ſome Nations, as in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in phlebotomy, where they make many Experiments upon wounded men, in ſtenching of blood, and in doing other great feats. For if any be wounded among them, falling into their hands, then the next day they open a vein, and that without meaſure and knowledge, not regarding how much the Patient hath bled already: but what good they effect thereby, may be ſeen out of this enſuing example, where I was an eye witneſs.</p>
                  <p>In a certain place (which for ſome reaſon ſhall go name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) I ſaw a wounded party, which had bled very much, and was brought very low thereby; the next day came the Doctor which undertook to cure him, who brought a Barber with him to open a vein of the Patient, who had already loſt too much blood; that opened vein could not bleed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was but little of blood in it, and that little Nature reſerved in ſtore for to help her ſelf withall. This Doctor would needs have blood, and ſeeing that that vein would not yeild ſo much as he expected, he cauſed another vein to be opened, whether that would ſatisfie his thirſt after blood, but little came out of it, and the poor Patient died under his hand.</p>
                  <p>This is related here not to that end, as if I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Phlebotomy altogether for the defence of the wounds: <note place="margin">Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> for I have ſeen more than once, that Phlebotomy hath done much good to wounded men, and fell out very well for their healing. I onely related it to that end, becauſe it is uſed by ſome very indiſcreetly, whereby they did all manner of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif: true, they give ſome reaſon why they do ſo, as namely, in reſpect of a rheum which fals down from the head (as they call it, ſo will I call it alſo) that it may not altogether fall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106818:21"/> upon the wounded ſide, but may be diverted, that the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded party may be in the leſſe perill. Whether this be ſo I cannot tell, nor can I agree with them herein, for the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of wounds take for the moſt part their cauſe from the place where the wound is, and not from the head, as I ſhall make further declaration of it, neither are theſe ſymptoms cauſed by the blood, but rather by the abuſes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, amongſt which this abuſe alſo (of the which I now treat) may be numbered. It is true, Phlebotomy is uſed with great utility, in all ſuch wounds, where the wounded have either gotten a Paroxiſme of a Feaver, or they fear one, which may be cauſed either by frights or by anger. Phlebotomy is uſed alſo with advantage, when a party hath received a ſtab in the body, and it is feared, that there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed blood in the body, in ſuch a caſe Phlebotomy is not onely advantagious, but alſo neceſſary, when the blow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was done either by force, or with a fall, and the party bled but little: eſpecially in head Wounds, which bleed but little: Such Wounds are dangerous, by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed blood, which by this meanes may be driven out.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt needs relate a cuſtom which ſome have to expel congealed blood: For when they have a wounded man in cure, eſpecially if his wound be in the body or bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if they ſuppoſe that there is congealed blood there, then they lay him on the ground, with the wound down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhake him to and fro, even as a Butcher uſeth to do with a Swine: in this manner they ſuppoſe to get the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed blood out of the body, all which is little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And if there be at hand a hot Feaver, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation (which is known by ſome ſignes, of the which ſhall be treated hereafter) there Phlebotomy may ſafely be uſed, but it muſt be done upon mature adviſe; for it is not good in all caſes; in ſome accidents it is good, and in ſome it is dangerous: therefore care muſt be had, to be ſure when it is neceſſary, and when needleſs. Many uſe Phlebotomy in all wounds without diſtinction, little regarding the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condition of the wound, whether in legs, armes, joynts, ſuppoſing to prevent hereby the Prunellain wounds,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106818:21"/> (known unto few) but they effect nothing at all thereby; for this raſh and indiſcreet Phlebotomy uſed keeps off none of theſe fore-named ſymptoms: if the Wound be in a dangerous place, then you muſt deal with it in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way, if ſo be you will be honeſt and get credit in the cure. This alſo muſt be made account of, that the leſſe the wounded hath bled, in the leſſe perill his life ſtandeth. But this is conſidered little by many, which are bluntly for blood.</p>
                  <p>Many do adviſe, if a bleeding Wound cannot be ſtenched <note place="margin">Many uſe Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſtench blood.</note> eaſily, then the Patient is to be phlebotomized in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide, and to let him bleed well, for thereby the bloud, as they perſwade themſelves, will take another courſe, and be drawn away from the Wound, (be the Wound never ſo big or wide, and never ſo many veines wounded) and the blood turned to the little and narrow mouthed veines open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But let them tell me, what reaſon they have for this, and whether this was ever done, that a bleeding Wound was ever ſtenched in this manner? Some reaſons were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their anſwer, but without any truth, becauſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth the clean contrary.</p>
                  <p>This is true, when the blood is thus inflamed, and in this <note place="margin">Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize when the blood is in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry courſe.</note> his anger, it taketh an unconſtant courſe, then through Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy this angry and impetuous courſe is in ſome ſort allayed. But without this anger, I know not to what end Phlebotomy ſhould be uſed, unleſs it were to bring the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient the ſooner to the Church-yard. For if a party were wounded in the four outer joynts, and at each did bleed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, on what ſide muſt he be phlebotomized to divert the blood from the Wound?</p>
                  <p>In this caſe much more could be alledged, and I reſt to make any further relation of it: of this I intended onely to give a hint, that when in the next part of this Book I treat of the ſtenching of blood through eaſie, mean and honeſt wayes and meanes, thereby to overthrow theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters, ſo the courteous Reader may the better underſtand, upon what occaſion I undertook the writing hereof.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What groſſe abuſes are crept in, in binding up freſh Wounds, with ſearching, groaping, grabling.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEing already noted more than once, how through the careleſneſs of Surgeons often evil and perillous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are cauſed, whereby afterwards are cauſed lameneſs-fiſtulaes, cankers and ſuch like; therefore is it needful to ſhew what manner of abuſes theſe are, intimated by the word careleſneſs. Having cleared the two head points, as ſtitching and ſtenching of blood, and ſhewed how groſſe abuſes are therein committed, I will touch alſo other abuſes which are as uſually committed as the other.</p>
                  <p>The next unto ſtitching and blood ſtenching, is that which is committed with the ſmall iron inſtruments, which by reaſon of ſeeking, are called the ſeekers or ſearchers, wherewith ſome do ſo ſeek and groap, as if they had loſt ſomewhat there, and deſire to know exactly of what large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Wound is, and of what depth the ſtab is, what vein be ſtabb'd, which bone be broken, and which be whole: this they do onely at the firſt time of binding it, which might be pardoned and excuſed, but as often as they dreſs it, ſo often do they ſearch the Wound. And if there be three or more Surgeons together, then is it not enough, that one with his ſearching iron ſhew his judgement and cruelty, but alſo after the firſt the ſecond, after the ſecond the third muſt ſeek for his loſt penny in the Wound, and thruſt up and down in it, the one more rudely than the other, beyond all the rules of juſtice: But how think you that the poor Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is thereby mortified and tormented?</p>
                  <p>But to what end is it, to groap and to grable ſo much in Wounds? Ah! how little do they conſider, that with that <note place="margin">A danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cuſtom to ſearch in the wounds.</note> poaking and ſearching they break and deſtroy that natural Gluten or Balſom (which ſettleth for the healing, and is the healing it ſelf) and ſpoil it altogether. Pray tell me, what elſe do they to a Wound, which in the ſaid manner
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106818:22"/> they ſearch and ſound, but to make another? I ſee no other thing uſed, but that they conſtantly play all upon one ſtring, and ſtill keep the old Ditty, and they alwayes uſe but one ſort of ſalves and ointment, one ſort of oyle, and one ſort of plaiſter, the Wound fareth a great deal the worſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that cunning ſeeker. Seeing there is but one thing uſed to Wounds, let there be found in it whatſoever it will, why ſhould the Patients be much tormented, which are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled enough already with their wounds? But it muſt be ſo, that their groſs ignorance and palpable rudeneſs may be brought to light, becauſe they know nothing elſe to uſe, be the Wound in what ſhape and form it will.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Surgeons found, who meerly for cuſtoms ſake make uſe of that little iron, becauſe they have ſeen it uſed, though they know little, what they ſeek for, or why they ſeek, but onely to make men beleive, that it is a thing of great conſequence, and that men ſhould hold them to be great Maſters, whereas all is but uſeleſs, nay often very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Being there is no defect in the Wound, why do they then <note place="margin">Searching doth great hurt.</note> moleſt the Patient with ſeeking, preſſing, griping, grobling and moiling in the Wound, and tormenting him thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably? for thereby not onely extream pains are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by touching his quick fleſh and veines with the iron, but the time alſo is prolonged to make him indure the more miſery, and then the Wound alſo is kept open the longer, and cannot ſo ſoon cloſe as Nature could deſire it: nay they undo that alſo, which hath been healed partly, as you ſhall hear more afterward. In caſe the Wound ſhould not be in a right poſture, ſurely that inſtrument will never ſet it righter, nor find its defect.</p>
                  <p>There are better wayes belonging hereunto, as ſignes <note place="margin">How to judge of a wound.</note> whereby the Wound is judged; <hi>viz.</hi> by the viewing of it, by the ſmell, by the matter, by the pain, by the form, colour, plaiſters, their working and ſuch like; by theſe ſignes we muſt know the Wounds condition, and into what ſymptoms it is like to fall,</p>
                  <p>Touching the form and colour of Wounds, take good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106818:23"/> notice of theſe ſigns, for they ought to be lookt to; if the brims or outſides of a Wound look red, it is no good ſign, and ſhews that there is a fault in the Wound: but if the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it look blewiſh and light, it is a ſign, that the Wound healeth; but if the skin about the Wound is dark blew, that is no good ſign, then the blood maketh the healed skin come off again, and now you muſt make vent with ſiſers, and cut that blewiſh part, to let the blood run out, elſe the new heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fals quite away, and by giving vent, then the new heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holdeth in part; if the Wound round about in the outſide feeleth hard, is ſwell'd, and looketh red, then is it a ſign, that the Patient is pained, and Impoſthumations are like to enſue, which is dangerous; if there be a ſwelling with a whitiſh skin, and feeleth to be full of water, and the Patient feeling a droughth at night, then good care muſt be had, for fear the cold fire ſhould grow on him, and if there be a ſtink in it, then the cold fire is already in it, and ſmels like a thing putrified, but is not ſo full of paines as the hot fire would cauſe; and in caſe he complains not, or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no pains, then his death draweth on, eſpecially if that cold ſtayeth long, then he ſoon dieth, or elſe fals into great danger, by reaſon of the wounded joynt.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſmell and its ſign, if a Wound ſmelleth ſtrongly, then the veines and ſinews are dying, and purge; for as ſoon as a Wound is dreſt, then alwayes the fleſh ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, and ſo do the veines alſo.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the corruption in Wounds, take notice of theſe enſuing ſignes: if there be white matter in a Wound like ſour milk, then a conflux of ill humours comes to it, and look from what ſide theſe humours come, for the Wound is now ſetled to a bad end: if a Wound be full of white mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then it is not in a full healing way, but is at a ſtay and delaying poſture: if there is red matter in a Wound, then ſome looſe piece is in it, or ſome other hinderance: if there is in a Wound ruddy and thick moiſture, inclining more to a fleſh and carnation colour than red, then that Wound is in a healing poſture.</p>
                  <p>Touching the pain, take notice of that ſign; if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106818:23"/> wound be moiſt and wateriſh, then there are pains at hand, and the joynt-ſponge is like to grow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the true ſigns, whereby you may have a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental information of a wounds condition, without theſe it is impoſſible to learn things aright about Wounds: and in this manner all may be known without putting the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to any further pain, much better, then with ſeeking, groaping, and the like, which is not onely uſeleſs, but very hurtful and painful.</p>
                  <p>As often as a vein or ſinew is toucht, as often is a new <note place="margin">Note.</note> pain cauſed; for they are very touchy and full of ſenſe, which ſenſe by that touch runs all the body over; and as often as you ſtir in a naked wound, as often ought it to be again cleanſed; for there is nothing to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cht in a naked wound, be it as little as it will, or as gently, there ſeparateth ſomething, and thruſts by the healing. For it cauſeth a flame, that is, the humidity of the naturall balſum, which alwayes like a chryſtal lyeth on the wound, ſhould not be taken off from the white ſmall veines, for they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be wiped off.</p>
                  <p>Now, as you heard above, if they keep a ſtirring too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the wound with the Seeker, is not the natural work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wound interrupted, and the wound in its healing obſtructed and prolonged, nay rather made worſe? For the blood-veines, to ſpeak onely of theſe, in the wound, are deſirous to thruſt off their healing, and to ſeparate that which is worſted and toucht. How often falls it out, that when a bloud-vein is ſtopped and deſireth to heal, then with that Inſtrument called Seeker, the healing is thruſt off, and the wound is put to bleeding afreſh? Is it not ſo, that thereby that which was once healed is wounded again, and ſo <hi>muſs de novo</hi> be healed?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this doubtleſs is true alſo, if you ſtir often in the wound with the Seeker, and alwayes the bloud-veines are thereby put to a ſweating, then commonly it turnes to a ſponge, and that principally in a joynt.</p>
                  <p>Note this of the Joynt-ſponge: firſt, what it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Ioynt-ſponge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106818:24"/> is, then how it is diſcerned, and laſtly, how the ſame may be cured.</p>
                  <p>Touching theſe three: a Joint-ſponge is nothing elſe but a moiſture of the ſinew-water, which groweth on and turneth hard, and ſettleth there. Some think, that in that place the healing is done, whereas it is a ſponge of joynt-water, and paineth the party: though it paineth him not, being touch'd, yet the party feels pain in that joynt, and is red and angry, burneth, and commonly lameth the party; it cauſeth lameneſs if it be not expelled betimes by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments. I have ſeen one of an eggs bigneſs ſtanding out before the joint, with Siſers I cut it off in the upper part, looks like boyled becon, toucheth like ruſty old bacon, onely that it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſofter and is tough; I applyed to the part I cut, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>uguentum Aegyptiacum</hi> prepared with Verdigriece, this takes it quite off, and the joynts pain is diminiſhed; though <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> biteth much, yet the other pain in the joynt moleſteth the party more intolerably. And the ſponge being gone, then muſt be uſed the brown ointment, either ſpouted in, or elſe conveyed in liquid; repent not the beſtowing of your ointment, for therewith you may ſhake the wound wholly, for it oppoſeth the ſinew-water vehemently, the pain ceaſeth, and the healing comes near. But in caſe you cannot well come to the ſponge to apply ſoft weeks, therefore there is a ſharp week, which ſurely will penetrate to it, and it is made in this manner; take of the green ointment made with Verdigreice, beſmear the week with it, then take another week, wrap it about the firſt, dawb it with the ointment, then ſpread it full thick with the green ſalve or ointment; this being put into the wound, feeling a heat, it melteth off the week, and is fed further from the inner week. This is that corroſive I ever uſed to my Patients; for it melteth and floweth better and ſooner than any corroſive or water; and it cometh to the holes where no water can reach unto, and it biteth not ſo long neither as other corroſives do, becauſe it is not onely of a drying, but of a moiſtening quality, and ſeparateth very eaſie, and reſiſteth forcibly the ſinew-water, called
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106818:24"/> the joynt-water. A better remedy was never known for this purpoſe, and found to do the feat, by ſeveral mens try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon my direction. And in caſe a joynt-ſponge ſhould grow, (which uſually happeneth in wounds neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; for in freſh wounds better care ought to be had to hinder the growth of a joynt-ſponge, or elſe it is not well with the wound) then you muſt deal according to the proceſs now rehearſed; and then the wound may be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to this direction ſpoken of.</p>

                        <hi>Of the abuſes which are committed with wicks, tents, lints, mullipuffs, &amp;c. chiefly in deep ſtabbings, illuſtrated with an example.</hi>

                  <p>VVIcks and ſuch like things are not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <note place="margin">Wicks are of good uſe, but abuſed.</note> as if they were of no uſe at all; no, but are well uſed in fit places and ſeaſons. This I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, which many do uſe, they ſtuffe wounds with lints, wicks, as much as they can hold, or are able to put into, without any diſtinction or diſcretion. Medicines ought to be put into Wounds, and not filled up with rags; and in caſe any wick or tent is uſed, it ought not to be forced in, but let it have a free paſſage, but to preſs them in with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as they commonly do, is not adviſeable, being both uſeleſs, dangerous and hurtful.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106818:25"/>
                  <p> For who doth not ſee, that wounds (which begin to cloſe and come together) are torn again, and kept aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and are not able to come together; and that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done in ſtitch'd wounds, and thereby the ſtitches are ſo pull'd and ſpann'd, that they tear out, to the greateſt pain of the Patient, which might very well have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. I do not approve at all of ſtitching, eſpecially in deep ſtabs, becauſe of the ſeveral miſchiefs and difficulties cauſed thereby, as a fiſtulo, which is ſuch an infirmity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which inwardly is wide and broad, but outwardly it is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of wicks further, is not thereby the wounds mouth ſtopt and cloſed? what enſueth upon? the matter cannot get thorough the ſhut-door, which ſhould come out, and naturally deſireth to come outward, and is by force kept in, unleſs the door be unbolted, and vent be made for it; in the mean while this matter doth little good in the wound, but rather great miſcheif. Beſides that the paines are mightily increaſed by that matter in the Patient, and this alſo doth further enſue, that the the ſinews grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſlimy and unclean, which cauſeth extream inconvenience and miſery. And how ſhould there any good come of it, when the wound is healed againſt Natures ſtream. Nature of her own accord doth drive well, but ſhe muſt be aſſiſted. Therefore when ſhe is deſirous to out-caſt the matter, why ſhould ſhe not be furthered in that work, and not hindered with rags? This not being obſerved, it happeneth, that when a wound is in a healing way, its made more dangerous, whereby more work is made than there was at firſt.</p>
                  <p>The bigneſs of a wick ſhould not fill out a wound, and if hard wrung in, it ſwelleth, and ſtops the wound, and no paſſage left for the matter, to get out, and is an obſtruction unto the healing; therefore is it better and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that wicks be made of a thin neck and a broad flap, thick in the middle, and not pointed, but round in the end, and ſoft, that it may the more eaſily receive the ointment, ſo that the ointment on the end of it may come to the bottom of the wound, and not on the top of the wound, for if the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106818:25"/> upper end of the wick be annointed, then the wounds top healeth, and maketh the mouth of it narrow, and healeth not from beneath upward, but if the ointment be put to the other end of the wick, then the fleſh healeth from below, &amp; before it driveth the ointment out of the wound, it turneth to a matter, and ſo healeth better upward: and if the wick be made big, then the matter ſtayeth below in the wound, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather corruption than any healing. But if a wound hath two mouthes, I very ſeldome ſtopt both, onely one, and left vent to the other, which furthereth the healing of the other.</p>
                  <p>It is helpful to let the wick be kept dry for a while in the wound, that the ointment on it may the longer keep in the vertue of it. For that reaſon I never wrung any wick into a wound, but let it have room enough, and let the wick fill up the wound below; pure cloth ought to be taken to wicks, the purer the better, for the looſe threeds of it if they ſtay behind in the wound, will cauſe miſcheif. Make your wicks thus (for ſo I found them to do beſt, when I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to keep open a Wound, without any pain) take pure ſmall flax, cut it even, then take two or three haires of the flax, as lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as you intend to have your wick, wind it about on the ſmaller end; the wick muſt be thicker in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle then on the top or above, and the top muſt be thicker then the end, the middle of it muſt be thickeſt, thus the wounds mouth is the better kept open: annoint the wick well with the green ointment, or wound-ſalve, it healeth the wound from beneath upwards, and the wick will not ſuffer the mouth of the Wound to grow narrow: you ought not to put any ſwelling wick into a Wound; and fit the wicks ſharp end ſo, that it open a little in the Wound; and fit it ſo, that the Patient be not put to pain; then the upper end of the wick you open as farre as you pleaſe, and wind it about with two or three haires, to keep in the in-turn'd wick: in this manner you need but two wicks to a Wound, and whileſt the oneſticketh in the wound, you may dry the other, and uſe it again; and if theſe be not dry enough, then make a freſh one. Freſh ones are better (but require
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106818:26"/> more toil) for cleanneſs ſake; ſuch wick you may uſe in Wounds, ſores, or where you pleaſe; I made uſe of them for the top and for the bottom, to keep the mouthes of the wounds the wider, that the ointment may be poured into, and run down the better. Other wicks, or tents, be they made of what they will, they ſuffer not the matter or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to paſs. And when you think your wicks did reach to the bottom (for they heal the deep way not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to narrowneſs or laterally) then cut them ſhorter in the pointed end, and leave that end round and ſoft, they prick not, and the ointment ſticketh the better on the ſoft round wick, than on that which is hard twiſted, and if you make them ſharp pointed, then the healed fleſh is pinched by them.</p>
                  <p>I know that Wounds may be kept open with theſe wicks a whole year and upward, and that the fleſh rather would preſſe forth by the ſide, then wear out the wick, or fill out that hollowneſs.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes I made long wicks (for fiſtulaes in the thighs) for the better framing of them, I took twigs or ſprigs out of a beſom, cut and ſcraped them, wound flax about them and made them ſtiffe, elſe they are not ſtiffe enough the long way, as they ſhould be; and wound a twig and a wyar together and covered them with flax, even as yarn may be roul'd up in wax to make a ſtiffe candle of it, and that wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and turneth according to the hollowneſs of the wound. I ſpeak here not of Wounds, but of hollow Sores, that are deep, a ſpan or more; they are thereby refreſhed and cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind of wicks I held in eſteem, and theſe flax wicks are to be uſed onely for ſuch Wounds which are kept open, whilſt other things about them are healed.</p>
                  <p>Further, I diſlike that cuſtome, when ſome fill up all ſorts of Wounds, be they where they will, with wicks, which is a very dangerous way and great abuſe. For if you muſt needs deal with the Wound in that way as hath been ſaid above, then firſt conſider the form and condition of the places where the Wounds are, whither they are able to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106818:26"/> bear wicks, yea, or no. For wounds are not alwayes in one condition, as ſome rude Aſſes ſuppoſe, who uſe but one ſort of ſalve and plaiſter, be the Wound what it will, no other, as if one pair of ſhooes could fit every bodies feet.</p>
                  <p>The place of the Wound ought to be conſidered, where many white ſmall veines concurre and meet, as in hands, feet and joynts. For where there are many white veines, there are no wicks to be uſed, for that reaſon, alledged part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, and partly in the precedent chapter, and for that alſo which followeth.</p>
                  <p>I have often ſeen, that when ſome had thruſt their wick into the Patients Wound, he felt ſuch pains, that his eyes did run over.</p>
                  <p>But what followed upon?</p>
                  <p>Nothing elſe, but that through their rude touching the ſinews by thruſting in the wick, forced the joynt-water to run; and not giving over with their wicks, they bereaved the poor man of his life, who might have been healed, if they had dealt honeſtly and diſcreetly.</p>
                  <p>More might be ſaid of this, but I will cloſe it with one particular Example, though I could quote a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>There was a Surgeon pretty well skill'd and experienc'd, in whoſe ſervice I lived one year, being ſome kinn to me, he was brought to a Patient, who was run thorough the ſhoulder at night time, the Surgeon dreſt his Wound (he ſhall go nameleſs now) that Wound did bleed much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a vein that run that way was hurt: the next day he opened the Wound, and thruſt two great wicks into it, the one before, and the other behind: with this wick he toucht the blood-vein that was hurt, which had been ſtenched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and made it bleed afreſh, which he regarded not at firſt, little thinking that he had cauſed it with the wick: and coming another time to dreſs his Patient, and going to pull out the wick, the blood burſt out again. Then he took notice, that the wick had cauſed it; but it was too late, for there was no remedy left; the poor man died,</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106818:27"/>
                  <p> Laſtly, it ought to be well noted, that if a Wound bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and you ſuppoſe it doth not come from any ſplinter or ſhatterd piece, which might be the cauſe of that bleeding, but from an opened vein, which was not quite healed, let that neither fright nor trouble you much, but do thus; make uſe of the Wound ſalve with the brown ointment mingled, that the Wound ſalve run the better into the Wound, and annoint therewith a lint, for tents of linnen cloth cauſe bleeding not ſo much as thoſe that are made of flax, for linnen is of a ſanative quality, in ſome veines, but they cloſe not ſo well, as the wicks do made of flax. Make this linnen wick very ſoft, and that it fill out the Wound, from whence the blood comes, and let it be thick at the upper end, that the blood may be kept in. Even as uſually Cotton wool is applied to the vein phlebotomized, lay here alſo Cotton wool to it. Briefly, cloſe and keep the blood in the Wound as well as poſſible you may, and keep the ointment alſo in the Wound, and thirty houres after dreſs his Wound again, and if the plaiſter and the wick comes off together, then make a ſofter wick for the place, and proceed as formerly, and if it doth keep on, let it ſettle or lie there, and ten houres after dreſs him again, and do not take-out the tent unleſs it be very looſe, then dreſs him again; for it healeth by degrees at every dreſſing, and the fleſh groweth as well ſo, as if dreſſed every hour.</p>
                  <p>This I ſpeak of to the end, that better care may be had about the wicks or tents, for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106818:28"/>
                  <p> The ſeveral hurts done to Patients thereby I paſs over, <note place="margin">A Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme choaks the wound.</note> and relate onely this; ſuch Poulteſſes do choak and ſtop the Wound in her courſe: for when ſuch a Poulteſs is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the wound, you ſee how it ſmoaketh, and what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that ſmoak? Nothing elſe but putrefaction. For Nature promoteth putrefaction, even as a Mother that breedeth a Child, and brings it to light. Now if theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſmes cauſe more hurt in wounds than good, as that ſmoak is an evident ſign thereof, why are they not omitted, but applied to places where they ſhould not? for in ſuch places there is moiſture enough without theſe?</p>
                  <p>I have known ſome Surgeons, who held it for a good ſign when they ſaw wounds ſmoak; but the good that comes of <note place="margin">Vapours in Wounds an ill ſign.</note> it, they may keep to themſelves, for I will have no ſhare in it. And to ſay it once more, if a wound doth ſmoak, it is an infallible ſign of putrefaction; for if ſuch a wound after dreſſing be not opened in two or three dayes, then a ſtink is at hand, which putrefaction thruſteth forth as her firſt fruit, and a wound, which begins to putrifie, whether it be ſo ſoon healed, as when it was freſh, let them tell it me? And to ſay nothing of the chiefeſt thing, which is the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; is it not hindered and kept back? For before you can come to the healing of it, you muſt firſt remove the putrefaction, and ſpend ſome time in it: Beſides the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and paines which this putrefaction cauſeth, it is moſt certain, that any wound, whoſe vent is taken away by the ſaid Poulteſs is forced to ſmoak, as you heard above.</p>
                  <p>And what is this ſmoaking elſe but a moiſture? which moiſture gathering together turnes into a water, as we ſee it in ſuch wounds which are thus papp'd up; for at their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening there is found a water round about, like drops of ſweat, which come meerly from that ſmoaking.</p>
                  <p>Now I ask, whether the water ſignifieth any good? and I ask further, whether any Medicine doth effectually work on ſuch wounds, thus forced to ſweat and to water, if dreſſed as they ought? In my judgement wounds that are thus compelled to dew, will hardly come to heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106818:28"/>
                  <p> And at the cloſing of this Chapter let me tell you thus much; any wound in a joint, be it in the hand, foot, or elſewhere, being choaked up in the ſaid manner, it keepeth a foul and angry bird in the neſt; and the Patient will be <note place="margin">A ſoul bird in the neſt.</note> pained in that place as often as the weather doth change, becauſe of that moiſture ſhut up in the wound; and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will hardly rectifie that unſound moiſture in a long time.</p>
                  <p>That up-ſhut moiſture will ſtir at the changing of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and at the encreaſe and decreaſe of the Moon; for the Celeſtial Lights do doubtleſs work upon the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, according to Gods ſingular Ordinance. Enough of theſe, let us proceed.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of all ſuch Surgeons which dwell in abuſes and errors, which know neither their weakneſs nor own Medicines, nor are able to judge of their operation, together of two Examples which ſhew the chiefeſt abuſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe higheſt and principal'ſt thing in a Surgeon and <note place="margin">It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous when men know neither the Medicine nor the hurt</note> Phyſitian is this, that he be a knowing and experienced man, not onely in wounds, hurts, ſores, but alſo in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines he intends to uſe to them; if not, then little good will be done: if a Doctor or Surgeon knoweth not the diſeaſe or ſore which are brought to them to be cured, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they know not what to call it, or of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it is, how ſhall they then apply a fit Medicine for them? Though ſometimes a blind man can give a name to the child (as the ſaying is) what helpeth it the Patient, if both theſe be unexpert in the operation and vertue of their Medicines, which they intend to miniſter: therefore the knowing of the Medicine and of the Diſeaſe muſt go hand in hand, if ſo be that any good ſhall be performed. For Taylors and Shoomakers uſually take meaſure to fit their Cuſtomers.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106818:29"/>
                  <p> But many profeſs themſelves Surgeons, and are ignorant Aſſes, which appeareth thus, becauſe they uſe one ſort of oyle and plaiſter to all manner of Wounds and Sores, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to do well therewith; and in caſe that will not doe it, then the Ceruſſa muſt do it: And what is the meaning of all this? nothing elſe, but that they know neither the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor their own medicaments, neither do they know what belongs to the diſeaſe, nor what the operation and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Medicine is.</p>
                  <p>They ſhould rather conſider, that the ſtomack in mans body, and the wounds in the outward members are like one <note place="margin">Wounds are like to the ſtomack</note> another in ſome ſort. For as the ſtomack hath a decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to digeſt the meats he feedeth on: ſo any wound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Medicine applyed unto for its healing. And as there are ſome kind of meats, which are not pleaſing to the ſtomack, &amp; it caſts them up upon occaſion; ſo it is not good to apply any medicine to a wound, one more, another leſs, according to occaſion, ſeaſon, place and circumſtance. And as a Phyſitian ought to know when the ſtomack doth not digeſt well his food, being grown either ſlimie, or taken cold, or when the liver is out of order, the which he muſt judge by ſignes, becauſe he cannot look into the ſtomack, and ſo order his Medicaments accordingly; ſo it behooveth a Surgeon alſo, who can plainly ſee into the wound (in that he hath an advantage before the Phyſitian) to know, whether the wound is able to receive and digeſt the applied Medicine, and muſt know, what food ſhe liketh, for her heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſeveral wounds have their ſeveral ſignes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore a Surgeon, when he hath dreſt any wound, and taketh the plaiſter off again, muſt know and judge by the wound matter, ſmell and ſhape, what defect there is in the wound: whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t hath received the medicine like a food, and hath digeſted it well, or whether it hath eaſt it up again? Therby he may know, whether his applied medicine be right and good, or whether it be defective, either too ſharp or too ſweet, too weak or too ſtrong: and if he finds the infirmity in the Wound, and the defect in the Medicine, then he muſt regulate himſelf accordingly.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106818:29"/>
                  <p> Now thoſe that underſtand themſelves thus, as ſoon as they have dreſt the wound, and have taken off the plaiſter, or any other thing, then they may eaſily know what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the wound is of, what will pleaſe it, and what is againſt it: and then they may well ſay, that they are Maſters in their Skill and profeſſion, and herein conſiſts the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of a Surgeon. But thoſe that underſtand thoſe things not at all, they will be in errors and abuſes in all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; ſuch may well hold their tongues, and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and learn their leſſons better, and go longer to ſchool. But where are ſuch Schools?</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe that undertake Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie are examined, and none is ſuffered to paſs for a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, <note place="margin">Novices in Surgery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe Maſter-pieces are found in Manuſcripts and in <note place="margin">How abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> print in ſeveral places of <hi>Germany:</hi> Some learn theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by heart, as Nunnes do their Pſalmes, and do well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and are accepted of in their Maſter-piece, though they never had any inſight into Surgery, nor ever learned the fundamentals thereof.</p>
                  <p>However I do not condemn theſe <hi>Examina,</hi> for I count them very neceſſary and good. For Taylors and other Tradeſmen ſuffer none to ſet up his Trade, unleſs he have made firſt his Maſter-piece: if it be the faſhion amongſt Weavers, where the matter is onely about a piece of cloth, why ſhould it not rather be in that noble Art of Surgery, which concerneth neither breeches nor doublet, as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, but it concerneth mans life and welfare.</p>
                  <p>Now I would fain ask ſome Examiners, why they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe that are not of their Opinion or Science? Surely if they ſhould examine them more cloſely, and ask reaſons of their ſayings, I know many would keep in their tongues, and learn their leſſons firſt, before they come to the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> O how many would be found faulty, onely in wounds,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106818:30"/> to ſay nothing of other ſimptoms, ſores, &amp;c. wherein ſome make no diſtinction at all in the healing of them, though it be of a high concernment; Some can make a long diſcourſe of it, how, what and where, but to no purpoſe, though they prate never ſo much. For if their reaſons be conſidered, touching wounds and hurts, and their original and cauſe, and their Medicines they uſe thereto, it would be found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, that they do not agree at all, which in honeſty ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>But what other reaſon is there here, but that they know neither the hurts, nor their cauſes, much leſſe their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor their own Medicines, and their operations, they underſtand them not, and what good can they effect in their cures? Hence commonly it falls out, that they are at a ſtand, know not what to do, and then they judge ſuch hurts and wounds to be incurable, of the which more largely ſhall be treated hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, hitherto ſpoken of, touching abuſes, might be more largely handled, and more abuſes alledged. But ſuppoſing the judicious Reader will by theſe gueſs eaſily at the reſt, therefore I let it reſt, and quote two Examples onely, which in general ſhew the abuſes, and ſo cloſe this firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſome fourteen years ago, a Noble <note place="margin">An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhewing all kind of abules.</note> German in a Duel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Polander received on his left hand a Wound near his little finger, croſs over the joynt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto were called the chiefeſt Phyſitians and Surgeons, which came riding on their Aſſes, and took the wounded into their cure, and dreſt him the firſt time, but how and what they had done then is unknown to me, becauſe I was abſent; the next day I went thither alſo to ſee their dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, at which I ſaw excellent rarities and myſteries, which I ſhould not ſpeak of, yet for the publick goods ſake I cannot hold my tongue. And when they undreſt him, they took off from the Wound the Poulteſs they applied, and with the little Seeker they ſearch'd round about in the Wound, which fell tedious to me by reaſon of the Patient, and the Wound being thus long ſounded, then the Phyſitians ſtept
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106818:30"/> aſide to conſult together, where an Anatomiſt made an eloquent diſcourſe, which of the veines, and which of the ſinews in that Wound were cut and hurt: after conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhewed and did an extraordinary Maſter-piece; for they took two flat wicks or tents of linnen, and dipt it in their joynt-wound-oyle, and thruſt them into the wound, whereof the wound gaped very much, then they laid a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter over it, and upon that a cloth full of medicinal Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes, which I cannot name all. In this manner they dreſt him; and there was no end of their ſeeking in the Wound, of their ſtuffing and cleanſing at their ſeveral dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>Now hear what happened, and what their Medicines did work: few dayes after the Wound began to water and to run, which we call the joynt-water. Then they fell a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him, uſed all manner of things they could think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cure the wound, but all to no purpoſe, for they could not ſtop the joynt-water: then more things they tried, and what? they tied and bound his arme very hard and cloſe by the elbow, hoping thereby to ſtop the courſe of the joynt-water, and other ſimptoms and rheumes coming from the head. But as they miſunderſtood the thing, ſo it went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectation. For as much as they miſt in the ſtopping of the courſe of the joynt-water, ſo much more there was cauſed an inflammation and ſwelling, whereby the wound grew moſt horribly ſlimie and dangerous, at laſt it ſwelled up to the arm; then grew on a putrefaction in the veines and ſinews, and holes fell in the arm of a fingers length, thus the arm rotted, For to ſuch ſimptoms truly belonged better Skill, then they brought forth and uſed. They ſuppoſing a heat had cauſed all this miſchief, which indeed was not heat, but a meer ſuffocation, the which they knew not, which they went to quench with Vinegar and Well water put together, waſhing the wound therewith, dipping clothes in it and applied them. But all this was not yet enough, for theſe remedies availing nothing, and the Patients weakneſs growing on more and more, then they fell on other things, met, and conſulted, and diſputed the cauſevery much, at laſt they reſolved to expell all theſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106818:31"/> ſimptoms out at the Patients Arſe, becauſe it could be no otherwiſe. Here Gliſters and Purges muſt walk, Sirrups, Electuaries, Decoctions of Honey and Sugar, all muſt help the poor Gentleman to ſome eaſe, for he was forced to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up a whole Apothecaries ſhop; when all came to all, the poor Patient died in great miſery. This was their good practiſe they uſed on that brave Gentleman: I have not told the fourth part of the abuſes they committed upon him, for it is too rude, and too groſſe, and pitty to have it told. An old Woman might have cured this Wound with a ſmall and mean hearb, without any danger and pain; but it is done.</p>
                  <p>An Italian Lord, at an Inn in <hi>Rome,</hi> was cut with a ſhort <note place="margin">Another Example.</note> Hanger above the elbow: the chiefeſt Doctors and beſt Surgeons were called, and the Wound was put to their cure, and they undertook him. Theſe Doctors and Surgeons uſed great rarities and Arts: after a ſhort diſpute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, the chiefeſt of them was to dreſſe the Patient, as being not onely a good Anatomiſt, but an expert and rare man, who took a linnen cloth dipt it in warm Wine, tied it about his two fingers, therewith he felt in the Wound, as deep as he could, and began to waſh the Wound, and to cleanſe, and to ſcour, even as if he were to ſcour a ruſty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; the Patient was ſo pained thereby, that he prayed him for God and <hi>Maries</hi> ſake to let him alone, but he had not done yet; then he took out his Seeker, ſearched and ſounded the Wound to and fro, and viewed it very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how wide, how deep, how long it was; then he fell on prating, the long and the broad way of the danger in the wound, and how this and that muſcle was hurt, and what danger it would have proved, if this or that had been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and hurt: what great danger he eſcaped, becauſe this and that was not hurt; and how good a luck it was, that this and that was not hurt and toucht, and ſuch like things more, too tedious to relate them all.</p>
                  <p>After his preaching, without which the Patient well could be, he took a cloath bedawbed it with a Salve and Oyle, thruſt it often through the wound, and at laſt he left it there,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106818:31"/> and thus he dreſt him curiouſly: whilſt he thus handled him, the Patient hardly held up, that he died not under his hand, yet he died that very day.</p>
                  <p>I could quote more of ſuch like examples, but I let it reſt ſo: this I ſhewed onely to that end, that every one may ſee into what miſeries Patients may fall, if they happen to fall into ſuch Surgeons hands, who think that all is well, what they do, however they handle the Patient; becauſe in that particular they have a grant upon Letters pattent, to profeſs ſuch Arts, and have read once a thing, which other men as well as themſelves have done alſo.</p>
                  <p>I forbear to nominate any man in theſe examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of thoſe Surgeons are ſtill alive, and the Reader would be never the nearer, though the parties had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. He that is touch'd herein, will ſoon take notice of, and eaſily know and acknowledge, that Surgery and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick doth not lie in the authority of any mans perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Gentleman in the City, or a Bore in the Country be a Surgeon. For the whole buſineſs lieth chiefly herein, whether he knoweth or underſtandeth the thing, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knoweth to meet and to fit Nature, yea or no: for in Phyſick without this no good can be done</p>
                  <p>All what hitherto I have written is not done in ſpight or diſgrace, onely that thoſe who are ſo obſtinate in their old errors, ſhould be led away from their old dance and old fiddle, and from their naughtineſs, and to take better things in hand, whereby Patients may reap more benefit. And it is an apparent truth, no naughty thing, be it never ſo anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <note place="margin">No nought is good be it never ſo antient.</note> and never ſo much uſed, can be made good; for I have ſeen many, who ſaid, it was not fit that old cuſtomes ſhould be left off, and to produce new things into their places; yea, thoſe were worthy to be ſeverely puniſhed that do ſo, becauſe they deſpiſe and condemn thereby the Antients and the Univerſities. Therefore in ſome places the Books of <hi>Theophraſtes Paracelſus</hi> (to whom the beſt and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Surgeons muſt give place) are prohibited to be read; but in my ſimple judgement it is done very fooliſhly. For it were to be wiſh'd, that old Cuſtomes were well underſtood
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106818:32"/> and followed, and not to bring in their own fancies, then things would fall out better then they do. Things may be brought to light, if Nature onely were well ſtudied, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teſtifieth, which is nothing elſe but Nature her ſelf.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Nature in her ſelf doth remain,</l>
                     <l>Which Experience makes known amain.</l>

                     <l>Things paſt do return again.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>What is that to me, what opinion <hi>Gallen, Avicen, Guido,</hi> &amp;c. hatch'd in their breaſts, were not the things they brought forth in their age, new things, and who knoweth, whether the ſame thing did not befal them then, which befals thoſe who produce new things now (as they call it.) <hi>Momus,</hi> who is never pleaſed, hath doubtleſs lived in thoſe times as well as now adayes, and beſides this, many things are done out of hatred and envie. Therefore it is beſt to conſent and to follow thoſe, which agree beſt with Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and commend and ſhew their skill effectually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: if any one findeth and learneth better things, though they more agree with antient things, who ſhall forbid him to make uſe of them?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt part of my Surgery books I treated of the abuſes, which are in full practiſe among the greater part and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be Surgeons, and ſhewed what miſchief is cauſed thereby, to the greateſt prejudice and ruine of poor wounded men. Yet have I not related all the abuſes which are practiſed and committed now adayes, becauſe that relation would be never at an end, &amp; would prove tedious to the Reader to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe them, and ſo I gave onely a hint of the groſſeſt, hoping that thoſe that know theſe, may eaſily gueſs at the reſt. In this ſecond part are rehearſed many abuſes, which every

               <p>Now I come for the preſent nearer to the buſineſs, and declare what belongeth unto Surgery. Therefore my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is to write in this ſecond Part of all ſorts of Wounds from the head to the toe, and of all kinds of infirmities which belong alſo unto Surgery, namely, how the ſame ought to be cured without any abuſe. Where I will bring in ſeveral ſubtle Manuals, which Surgeons advantageouſly may uſe, and will conceal nothing, as much as is known unto me. Let the Courteous Reader be perſwaded, that I will have great care to bring and ſhew nothing which I know to be not true, but that which I have made tryal of, and ſeen experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, what good it hath done, and what hurt it did.

For to what end are ſuch great volumes, in which there is no utility but hurt? it had been better they were quite let alone, then they would have done no hurt: It is better a book be ſhort and good. To what end ſhould it be, to write a great volume, and to ſhew in it even thoſe things, which others before me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, more or leſs, have written. Is it not ſo, thoſe that are minded to read them, would rather read them in their own books, according to the verſe:</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What a Surgeon ought to know.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is well known to thoſe that have any underſtanding, that Art doth imitate Nature: for all what Nature ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">Art imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Nature</note> the ſame Art undertaketh to imitate. Therefore men ought to obſerve Nature in their actions, and regulate themſelves after her, if ſo be they intend to have good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in their undertakings. For Nature may as little be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, as a ſtrong River may be ſtopt in his courſe; even ſo nothing will prove proſperous, if undertaken againſt Nature.</p>
                  <p>Seeing things ſpoken are really found ſo, therefore it is reſolved upon, that a Surgeon is Natures ſervant, and that he ought to endeavour to imitate Nature, becauſe ſhe will not be in ſubjection to any. Therefore in Surgery nothing ought to be done againſt or contrary unto her. For if a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106818:34"/> Surgeon ſhould undertake to do and to force Nature, then he would not onely labour in vain, but alſo would make the laſt be worſe than the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Though it be not my deſire, that a Surgeon ſhould have a <note place="margin">Nature muſt be known.</note> perfect knowledge in all natural cauſes, becauſe there are many things which concern not his Profeſſion, though it would do him no hurt if he knew them: however Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requireth to have a good knowledge of ſuch things that concern him; as of Wounds, and of Medicaments which he uſeth to them, and of all ſuch things that depend upon; in all theſe he ought to know of what nature and condition each of them is, that he may prepare his Medicine according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe all Wounds are not cured one way.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when he vieweth a Wound, and conſidereth the place and ſcituation of it, thereupon he muſt preſently conſider the condition and quality of that place, whether that Wound be mortal, or whether by Gods help it be cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it exquiſite, that a Surgeon be well ſeen in Anatomy, of which among us there is great defect, ſo that <note place="margin">A Surgeon ought to be an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My deſire is not, that a Surgeon ſhall and muſt have a perfect knowledge in Anatomy, ſo that he ſhould know where every ſinew, vien and other parts of the body lie, even to the leaſt, for that we leave unto thoſe which make profeſſion of Anatomy, whom we deſire not to take it from; onely Neceſſity requireth thus much, that he have a ſuperficial knowledge of it, eſpecially of mans bones, that he may know how the ſame are joyned and ſtand together, as well in the head as in other members, eſpecially the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, For it happeneth many times; that joynts are diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, which muſt be ſet again, which he will hardly do, that knoweth not how they ſtood formerly. He muſt know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the chiefeſt ſinews and bloud-veines, and muſt know their ſcituation, from whence they come, and whither they go, and how they run together and meet, and ſuch like. For this he may well know, which places are dangerous, to deal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106818:34"/> the more diſcreetly, and to order and prepare his Medicine the better, all according to occaſion of things. He muſt know alſo the internal joynts and members, and the chiefeſt occaſions touching places; as alſo the principalleſt muſcles, what they do cover, and what they move, and ſuch like things, and all this to that end, that when he onely looks upon a Wound, he inſtantly may know what part be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo he needs not to ſtir and ſearch much in the Wound with the Seeker, of which in the firſt part hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely. He ought to know how to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Wound be mortal or no, whether it may be cured wholly without any lameneſs; of all which he can neither know nor judge certainly, unleſs he have good skill in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy (if not in the whole, yet at leaſt in ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:) And this is the reaſon, that ſo many bone-fractures keep crooked, and ſo many joynt-wounds prove a lameneſs, if ſo be it fals out ſo luckily, becauſe Surgeons have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in theſe things, or very little.</p>
                  <p>And whereas T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

For Experience, that great Teacher, tels us to be nought, at all times to undertake for health: whereas it may well happen, that that Medicine, wherewith in ſummers time a Wound is cured, the ſame may ſpoil a Wound in the winter; ſo of other reaſons may be argued. Therefore a Surgeon ought to learn, how to fit himſelf for the time, and prepare his Medicaments accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to uſe them more or leſs, either to ſtrengthen or to <note place="margin">To obſerve a diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Wounds.</note> weaken withall; all according to occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Surgeons ought to diſtinguiſh Wounds, whether they run downwards or upwards, and to order things according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106818:35"/> with the out or in running, and to make their ſalves and plaiſters accordingly, either thinner or thicker, ſo as ne ceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requireth in the application: and they muſt know and judge alſo by certain ſigns, whether a Wound be poyſoned or no, whether it be ſpoiled or no: for among theſe one Wound is not like the other, and each muſt have a particular cure.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon eſpecially ought to obſerve the ſignes, which partly ſhew themſelves in and by the Wounds, and by no <note place="margin">Signs are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> means to ſlight them, let them be never ſo mean; for every ſign, be it never ſo ſlight in the appearance, ſingnifieth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and maketh him that obſerveth it to conſider of ſomething already come into the Wound, or at leaſt at hand. And ſigns in the Wounds have their ſpecial ſignification, be it good or bad, eſpecially they foretell of ſimptoms, which partly are coming on, of the which in the third part of this book ſhall be treated: therefore it is neceſſary, that every Surgeon take notice of the ſigns, by reaſon of the ſimptoms, which a body in health is alſo ſubject unto; hence it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that the ſigns, be they never ſo ſlight, ought not to be ſlighted, as from thence great miſcheif ariſeth, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in time, and are oppoſed ſeaſonably. He that hath good judgement herein, is worthy of honour, and to be commended for a good Surgeon.</p>
                  <p>The nature, complexion and condition of the Patient ought to be known, and obſerved; for ſome are ſtrong, <note place="margin">The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents nature ought to be obſerved.</note> ſome are weak, ſome of a cold, others of a hot complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome of a moiſt, ſome of a dry nature, ſome are ſubject to ſpecial Diſeaſes, and have them already, as Feavers, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jaundice, when they were wounded.</p>
                  <p>After ſuch circumſtances and occaſions a Surgeon ought to regulate himſelf, and to debate from the one, and to add to the other. For a ſtrong Medicine is to powerfull for a weak body, and overcomes his nature; and a ſtrong body cannot be hurt by a weak Medicine: and it happeneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as hath been ſaid, that the bodily Diſe aſes ſtrike into the Wounds, and make the ſame worſe. Therefore a care is to be had, for every ſort of wound requireth a particular
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106818:35"/> cure, and he that undertaketh to cure all theſe with one ſort of Medicine, he doth no leſs, as if he ſtrove to put two feet into one ſock.</p>
                  <p>For it is not onely required; that a Surgeon know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Medicine &amp; Wounds muſt be known e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</note> of the Wound and of the Patient, but he ought to have alſo good knowledge of his Medicines, whether they be compounded or ſimple, that he may know how they are fitted for the Wound, whether they burn, or obſtruct, or work any other way, that he deal diſcreetly, and prepare the Medicines accordingly: for when he ſeeth that the Wound cannot brook with the Medicine, but are contrary one to another, then that Medicine you muſt caſhier, and take a better for it, and rectifie that which the firſt hath ſpoiled; but if he finds that the Medicine hath done well, and was either too ſtrong or too weak, then muſt he know how to add or how to debate, according as the thing requireth, which he ought to know; in which caſe Alchymie fitteth a Surgeon exceeding well, but that is almoſt all the world over fallen into contempt, by reaſon of the great abuſe that is committed therewith; which however I count it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that a Surgeon ſhould have skill in it; for that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will teach him to know the inſide and outſide of things, by which means he will be able to prepare his own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, to ſeparate the poyſon from the good, and the pure from the impure, according as he is expert in that Art. If a Surgeon firſt knoweth the hurt and Wound, and then knoweth the efficacy of his Medicaments, then he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know alſo, what is good or nought for the Wound, and how according to the condition of it he muſt diminiſh or increaſe his Medicine, all which lieth in learning, which is never at an end as long as man liveth.</p>

                  <p>For how ſhould a drunken Surgeon judge of a hurt or wound, when he in his head is alwayes diſturbed, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of his true ſenſe?

                  <p>A Surgeon ought to take heed alſo, not to permit every one to look into the Wound, as many uſe to do. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the cuſtom in many places, that the Mageſtrate ſends ſworn Surgeons to view Wounds, therefore I neither can nor will diſprove that cuſtome, but I ſay, it is very neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, and ſhould be ſtrictly maintained, that in caſe a Surgeon ſhould have nothing for his pains from the party, he might have a recourſe to them; but I can by no means approve, that rude and unexpert perſons are ſuffered to come to ſuch Patients, as they do upon an Order made by them; whereas it is more fit, that the beſt experienced Surgeons ought to be choſen thereunto: thoſe afore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rough and rude Surgeons make ſhew as if they had great judgement in the Art, themſelves alone are able to ſound, groap and ſearch in the Wound, and ſo with their Inſtrument they ſearch therein, as if they had loſt ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106818:36"/> in it, and are like a blind man, which feeleth with his ſtick for his way.</p>
                  <p>Now when theſe rude Surgeons get a Wound into their hands to cure, then he that hath dreſt the Wound already muſt ſhew and let them ſee the Wound, by reaſon of the judgement they are to give of it. But it is a thing not to be ſuffered, to ſound and to groap in the Wound, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged in the firſt part; the Patients advantage ought to be conſidered, and the reſt regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, a Surgeon ought to obſerve his Patient, that he eat and drink not all he hath a mind to, of the which more ſhall be ſpoken hereafter. For Patients are like Children, ſtill deſiring ſuch things which are offenſive and hurtfull. For if the Surgeon give liberty to Patients in this, then he would be acceſſary to the evill that ſhould enſue upon. Therefore he ought faithfully to warn him to take heed to himſelf; for in caſe he ſhould not do well, then all the fault would be laid upon the Surgeon: if he before-warned, he doth well to keep unto it, if not, let him take what fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HItherto it hath been ſaid, what knowledge a Surgeon ought to be of, and how he muſt behave himſelf in many things, both towards himſelf, and then towards his Patient. Now order requireth further, that I come nearer to the buſineſs, and ſpeak more properly of the Wounds, and of their Cures: however things hitherto ſpoken of concerns the buſineſs very much.</p>
                  <p>I will now touch things further, and firſt before I come to the cure and healing of Wounds, me thinks it is good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106818:37"/> and neceſſary, to ſhew in what manner a wounded party ought to be kept in the diet, becauſe this particular is many times of as great concernment as the Medicine it ſelf: yea, when things are brought to a good paſs by Medicaments, the ſame are ſpoiled and turned about by immoderate feeding. Is it not often ſeen, that ſound and ſtrong bodies ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſound food? (I ſay nothing of unſound ones:) if they tranſgreſs in the meaſure and time, what marvel is it then, if the like happeneth to unſound and wounded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                  <p>With ſome vulnerary potions Wounds in part may be healed; and may thereby be made worſe alſo, and quite ſpoiled. Hence any underſtanding man may eaſily judge, that a true moderateneſs in eating and drinking, is none of the leaſt things that are neceſſary unto healing.</p>
                  <p>A diſtinction is to be obſerved in the perſon, if it be man or woman, that the Surgeon may fit either with a diet; <note place="margin">A diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be had of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</note> for it is not good indifferently to feed upon meats, for that which is good for man proveth very naught to a woman; and again, what is good for a woman is naught for a man. The reaſon is well known, and in many examples made good, and ſo I avoid herein any prolixity of diſcourſe. And this diſtinction is alſo to be obſerved in perſons, whether the party be tender and ſlender, or whether of a robuſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as the precedent Chapter made mention of. And according to the diſtinction of perſons a diſtinction to be obſerved in their diet; and the Climate of the Country is to be obſerved alſo. For ſome Countries are better, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, drier and moiſter than others, and as theſe qualities are contrary one to another, even ſo are the Inhabitants of theſe Countries in their complexions contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and that which is good for a Saxonian in a Simptom, the ſame proveth hurtful to an Italian in that weakneſs. I will ſay nothing here of the age, whether the wounded party be young or old, becauſe every one ought to know, that this diſtinction alſo is not to be ſlighted, as Experience teacheth us. Neither will I mention the place where the Wound is, be it inward or outward, above or below, before
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106818:37"/> or behind: Neither will I make any words of the time, in which a party is wounded, whether it be done in Summer or Winter. For I do not beleive that any Surgeon is ſo rude and ignorant, that ſhould not be ſenſible of, that a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be had of a Summer and of a Winter Seaſon, touching heat and cold: And I mentioned it onely for that end, that every one may ſee, that it is fit Surgeons ſhould obſerve ſuch diſtinctions about perſons, and ſtill be regulated after the form and condition of things, as well in the diet as elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſaid diet; ſome have that cuſtom, as ſoon <note place="margin">Abuſes in diet forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as they have got a Patient into their hands preſently forbid him Wine, Beer and all good Meats, and make Decoctions for him, which are very unſavoury, and would make a ſound body ſick; however ſome meats are forbidden, as Cabbage, Coleworts, Pork and Bacon, all manner of water Fowls and Fiſhes, becauſe theſe are of hard digeſtion, and give no good nouriſhment to the body; and ſuch food is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which nouriſheth well.</p>
                  <p>A certain Phyſitian forbidding all meats to his Patient, was asked, what his Patient ſhould eat then? He ſaid, young boyled Cocks: he was laughed at! What diet is good for a wounded party? Uſe him like a Woman that lies in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the ſeveral Countries; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it further, not onely in general, but in particular alſo, as much as concerns eating and drinking.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the meats, let the wounded ſuffer no hunger, and what he hath a mind too let him have it, in caſe it be not hurtful to him, obſerving the ſex, age and climate of the Land, as you heard above. Neither ought the Patient to be forced to eat this and that, which goeth and is againſt his ſtomack, that Nature may not be oppreſt, whereby dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would be cauſed. And this muſt be obſerved when the Patient hath a ſtomack to eat. For ſometimes Patients have loſt their ſtomack; in ſuch a caſe what is to be done? Then endeavour to give him ſome Cordials to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his ſtomack. But in caſe the Patient will take none? Then apply ſtomack-plaiſters, and uſe the oil of Nutmegs &amp; Mace.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106818:38"/>
                  <p> I will ſet down how to make good broth for the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſtrengthen his ſtomack withal.</p>
                  <p>Take a Hen, or in want of that a piece of lean Fleſh, cut <note place="margin">Good Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the wounded.</note> it in pieces, put it in a pot, put Calmus, Cinnamon and Salt to it as much as will ſeaſon it; lute the pot, and let it boyl for three hours in a ſufficient quantity of water; at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of it you will have good broth, pleaſant to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſtomack; or boil and roaſt ſuch things, as you ſhall think fitting for him.</p>
                  <p>Touching his drink; wounded men being alwayes more <note place="margin">His drink.</note> dry than hungry, having loſt much blood, their Liver ſtriveth to have that want ſupplied: beſides, bloud is like a food to the Wound, and drink generates bloud, and the more bloud the drink breeds, the ſooner the Wound healeth. Hence you may note, that the wounded muſt have drink ſufficient, and let him not ſuffer thirſt, or keep him not too dry, as ſome uſually do, for thereby miſchiefs are cauſed, as daily experience witneſſeth. But the diſtinction mentioned at the beginning of this Chapter ought to be well obſerved, and let the drink be neither too hot nor too cold, and not too much Salt to be uſed; ye may permit him ſmall Wine to drink, which is very good for ſuch parties, eſpecially when the party hath loſt much bloud; but no Wine is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if the Wound be mortal, and in the head, or any great Wound of the body, be it inward or outward The ſame rule is to be kept in ſuch Countries, which affordeth but Beer. Let the drink be what it will, the Patient ought to be kept in a cool temper rather than in a hot, in which caſe Barly water is of good uſe.</p>
                  <p>I adviſe no wounded party to drink great draughts at a <note place="margin">No great draught good for them.</note> time, for ſuch haſty drinking oppreſſeth the Liver, which is hot and dry, and would prove no better, then when oyl is poured into fire to quench it withall, and thereby the Liver would be obſtructed and hindered in her ſending forth nouriſhment to the reſt of the members, as being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and hindered in her operation, which would cauſe great inconveniences, and a ſlime would ſettle about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and choak her, and being thus obſtructed, how can the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106818:38"/> veins receive any bloud, and you may eaſily gueſs what the iſſue would be.</p>
                  <p>Touching other things, the Surgeon ought to obſerve, <note place="margin">Haſty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hurtful</note> that the Patient do not ſtir and move too haſtily, whereby great pains would be occaſioned unto him, as the Gout, Falling Sickneſs, Feaver, Cramp, Inflammation and ſuch like are cauſed by ſuch violent motions, chiefly, let wounded parties not practiſe Venereous luſts, whereby the worſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are cauſed.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon obſerving all theſe things carefully, then there is hope, by Gods help, of good ſucceſs in his Art, for the good of his Patient, and the Patient alſo ought to behave himſelf accordingly. For all dorh not lie in the teaching, but in the learning alſo. For if a Patient be unruly, not caring for the Surgeons inſtruction, but fall on gourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing and drunkning, then no good is to be looked for; becauſe the Patient refuſing all natural helps, like a Swine trampling on Pearls, cannot expect any cure, and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon looſeth his credit and reputation, and all his pains he beſtowed will be in vain.</p>

                        <hi>Of three accidents commonly befalling wounded men, a weak ſtomack, a ſtoppage in the urine, and not going to ſtool, how theſe are to be remedied.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WOunded men are ſubject unto many Diſeaſes, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſheweth, among the reſt there are three things which commonly befall wounded men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a Patient that hath loſt much bloud hath a weak ſtomack, which keeps not his meat nor digeſteth it, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth it up, whereby he falls into great danger, and the Wound ſhuts not, nor is it fed naturally, and the healing is put back.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, his urine alſo is ſtopt, and can hardly make
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106818:39"/> any water, whereby inflammations and other miſchiefs are occaſioned.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the wounded are bound in their body, cannot go to ſtool, and this uſually befals wounded men, whereby gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in the belly are cauſed: theſe three accidents muſt be helped in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſtomack, to help him to right, that he may <note place="margin">To help the vomiting.</note> keep his meat, make uſe of this following Receipt: Take Mint, Wormwood, <hi>ana</hi> M 1. Ginger, Calmus and Nutmegs cut ſmall, <hi>ana</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. boyl theſe in Wine and Water for an hour together, then take a great ſponge, or in want of it a four doubled cloth, dip it in the foreſaid boyled liquor, preſs it out again, and apply it hot to the ſtomack, his vomiting will be ſtayed; this muſt be iterated twelve times a day, and will cauſe an appetite. Vomiting is not very dangerous, and is ſtayed ſometimes of its own accord, and is not much to be regarded, unleſs it hold the Patient vehemently, then is it time to help him.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſtopping of the urine, the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt <note place="margin">To help the ſtopping in the urine.</note> I made uſe of with good ſucceſs. Take Anniſe ſeed ℥ 2. put it in a pewter bottle, pour Water to it lb 1. keep it ſtopt, and boyl it in a Kettle full of Water, in this Anniſe ſeed water dip a ſponge, apply it to the Patients privy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as hot as he is able to endure it, this provoketh urine. And if this be too weak, and doth not prevail, then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt muſt be made ſtronger thus: ℞ Anniſe ſeed, and parſley ſeed, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 1. Maiden-hair M 1. Berberries <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1. boil theſe in Vinegar and Water, to one pint of Vinegar put three quarts of Water, boil away a third part of it, and uſe it as you heard above. And if theſe outward means will not help, and the Patient is pained in his Urine, then inward meanes muſt be uſed: <hi>Viz.</hi> Maiden-hair, Alkekengi, <hi>&amp; oculi cancrorum,</hi> take a ſufficient quantity of theſe, as of Maiden-hair ℥ ſs. of Alkekengi or Winter-cherries ℥ 1. lay it in the Patients drink, and let him eat the <hi>Oculi Cancrorum,</hi> doubtleſs it will provoke his Urine, in caſe outward means be uſed alſo.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106818:39"/>
                  <p> Touching his going to ſtool, this is not much to be ſet by, <note place="margin">To help him to ſtool</note> eſpecially when the wounded ought to lie on bed: but if he hath no ſtool in three or four dayes, then is it time to look to his back dore. Some think to remedy this with purging, but in my judgement it is not good, it is alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with danger, eſpecially in head-wounds: it is better to make Suppoſitories of Honey and Mice turds mingled with Salt, and if that will not help, then make a Gliſter of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, oyl of Cammomil and fleſh-broth, and put Salt to it, and miniſter it: and if that be two weak, then ℞ <hi>Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Diaphenicum</hi> ℥ ſs. oyl of Cammomil ℥ 3. Mallows ℥ ſs. beaten, pour on theſe a quart of Water, (Fleſh-broth were better) or Goats Milk, ſtir it well about, apply it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too hot nor too cold, you will ſoon ſee the effect of it, you may put Salt to it if need. But in caſe the wounded ſhould be purged, then the ſafeſt way is to make a Potion of Sene leaves, and Rubarb, and miniſter it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of thoſe three accidents, uſually befalling wounded men: ſometimes other Diſeaſes are incident alſo, which are to be remedied as there is occaſion for: Of other Simptoms which happen unto Wounds, ſhall be treated in the next part of this Book, where I intend to write of them.</p>

                  <p>ALL manner of Arts being invented through experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge and exact obſervations, and even till now, <hi>dies diem docet,</hi> one day teacheth another, I hold it a thing impoſſible, conſidering the brevity of mans life, that an Art can be ſo exactly learned, but the after-comers find ſomewhat more in their practical part; and ſo it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſet all down, what belongeth to Surgery. As much as is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106818:40"/> known to me I will communicate in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Note, the dreſſing of a Wound is of great concernment, to handle it well, and to uſe and take notice of advantages, which ſome little regard, and dreſs their Wounds without any difference or diſtinction, whereby they effect this, that they lame thoſe, which could be ſet upright if, they had been honeſtly look'd too. Sometimes it happeneth, that neither the Wound nor the Medicine applied is in fault, but the fault was committed at the dreſſing. A Wound may be furthered in the healing, if well dreſt and bound: and a Wound may be ſpoiled in the dreſſing, and a lameneſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: as when a wounded member is bound too hard, then is a ſwelling cauſed, the Wound is choaked, having left no vent to help it ſelf and to receive any life: yea, I ſay this, that if a Wound were onely kept clean, and duly dreſſed, it would ſooner heal, than if all the Art of Medicine had been uſed, and all the Poulteſſes applied to it.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that binding is of great conſequence, therefore <note place="margin">Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the binding.</note> take good notice of all the parts of the body, and chiefly of thoſe that are dangerous; in ſome Wounds there is great danger, in ſome there is leſs, and that according to their places.</p>
                  <p>And obſerve exactly the Wounds on the Shinns, Knees, Cartilages, Armes, Hands, and where there is any joynt, for thoſe are dangerous, require great care, by reaſon of unhappy Simptoms, which eaſily fall i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> looked to, but require not ſuch exactneſs in the dreſſing, and are for the moſt part dreſſed ſo, that the Medicine applied may not fall off.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Wounds alſo, with a flap hanging down, which require a careful dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have undertaken Surgery, muſt have a care to be ready, and have in readineſs Salves, Plaiſters and other <note place="margin">Surgeons muſt be ready at all times.</note> neceſſary Medicines, well prepared, that at what time ſoever any Patient be brought to them, he may find good counſel
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106818:40"/> and preſent help, and not to tarry for their readineſs, or ſtay till they make and prepare ſomething, which tarrying would prove hurtful and prejudicial to the wounded, by reaſon of his bleeding, and other diſturbations; for the readier you are to dreſs him, the better the healing proſpereth, and the more credit it will be for you. And when any comes to be dreſſed, you ought to endeavour to be ready with your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Plaiſters, Salves, Lints, Roulers, that the Wound be not kept long undreſſed, and be ſpeedily covered and cloſed.</p>
                  <p>And that muſt be obſerved for that reaſon, that the air be <note place="margin">Air hurtful to Wounds.</note> kept out as much as poſſible it may, for air doth hurt to the Wound, eſpecially air is contrary to veins, ſinews and joynts, uſually cauſing cramps and ſtitches; and the room, in which the Patient is dreſſed, ought to be kept ſhut and cloſed, to keep out the air and wind.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon ought to be careful, that he breath not into the <note place="margin">Not to breath into Wounds.</note> Wound, eſpecially when he is yet faſting, and is to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mouth from the Wound, or ought to put a cloth before his mouth, if need, for ſuch breathing may cauſe that a water may ſtick to the Wound, and incline it to a rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But this is chiefly noted in Head-wounds, when the Pan or the <hi>Dura mater</hi> is wounded, for then it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Some Surgeons have that cuſtom at the dreſſing of <note place="margin">The blood in the Wound is to be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> Wounds, that they waſh the bloud out they find in the Wound, thinking it to be done very well, freeing it from uncleanneſs, and this they do at the firſt dreſſing. But it is an abuſe, and a thing contrary; no bloud ſhould be waſhed out of the Wound, but let it be there, if ſettled; for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed bloud in the Wound is no hurt unto it, and is rather beneficial, by keeping out the air, which otherwiſe would hurt the ſinews, and it hinders the bleeding of the veins, which they would do, if the congealed bloud be wiped out; it takes away the fleſh, for it is a right fleſh-glue, exceeding a Sarcocolla, and it healeth other Wounds if uſed, much more that where it lieth, and it furthereth the matter in the Wound, and haſteneth the healing, and though it were not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106818:41"/> ſo, yet it breaketh forth gently without any pain, and that of its own accord from beneath upward: therefore in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular moleſt and trouble the Wound no further, as to wipe out the bloud.</p>
                  <p>An honeſt Surgeon ought to have care of wounded joynts, be the Wounds great or ſmall, and obſerve a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their dreſſings, and bind them not too hard: a ſmall joynt muſt not be bound ſo hard as a great one, it cannot brook with it.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon for the general ought to endeavour to order his bindings ſo, that the Wound be kept together, and the joynts in the hands ought to be dreſſed and bound commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly, whereby lameneſſes are prevented.</p>
                  <p>Touching the binding it ſelf, how it muſt be performed, <note place="margin">Note the manner of binding.</note> note thus: No joynt, neither from above, nor from below, muſt be bound in the beginning, but let it alone, otherwiſe the bloud is driven inward or down, which would cauſe a putrefaction, and an inflammation; but that binding muſt begin in a convenient place, either higher or lower then the joynt, and that very gently: thus dangers will be avoided, and ſwellings prevented, which in Wounds commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
                  <p>The Swathing-bands muſt be made choice of alſo, for all <note place="margin">What ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-bands they muſt uſe.</note> do not fit, nor are good for it. For a Wound that is to be dreſſed, requireth that the ſwathing-bands be ſoft, and keep aſunder, that they may lie on the cloſer: ſuch ſwathing-bands are beſt made of old and worn linnen, becauſe they are very ſoft, yeeld the ſooner, being retched and pulled, lie cloſe on, keep the Medicine the better to the Wound, and cauſe no trouble nor moleſtation. But ſuch Swathing-bands, which purpoſely are woven with two ſelfedges, or ſuch that are hemmed on both ſides and ends, theſe are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Wounds, becauſe ſuch hems cut deep prints into the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Swathing-bands: more could be ſaid in that behalf, but to bring in all what could be ſaid, would be too great a labour. He that deſireth more, let him adviſe with Experience, which is able to put a Knighthood upon him.</p>

                        <hi>Of Head-wounds, what behaviour the Surgeon is to be of, both toward himſelf, and toward the Cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw it is time to come to the Wound it ſelf, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <note place="margin">As the Wound li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo it muſt be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the cure thereof as it ought to be; hitherto I ſwarved round about; Here great care ought to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the condition and diſtinction of it: For as the Wounds lie diſtinctly, ſo they muſt be cured diſtinctly; and as the one part of the body is ſtronger than the other, ſo the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines muſt be prepared accordingly. For a Head-wound cannot brook with ſuch ſtrong Medicines as a Wound may in the leg; and a Wound in a joynt cannot endure ſuch great clotter as that which is in the fleſh: theſe things ought to be obſerved, and more ſhall be ſpoken of in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters.</p>
                  <p>And I will begin with the Wounds in the head: I know what order I ought to keep in their deſcription: namely, firſt of the ſlighter Wounds, afterward of the broken Skull, and then of others alſo, and to ſpeak of their ſeveral cures. But this order I do not obſerve, for that reaſon, becauſe they are cured almoſt one way. Therefore I will write onely of dangerous Wounds of the head, where not onely the skin is broken, but the Skull alſo, and ſuch like. For he that can cure ſuch a dangerous Wound, truly he will be able to cure a ſlighter Wound.</p>
                  <p>This uſed order ſerves to ſhew how dangerous Wounds are. For to ſay they appear clear and clean, but afterward they caſt up looſe and ſhattered pieces of fleſh or bone, and one thing or other appeareth, and ſo I regulate my ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the doctrinals, touching the Head-wounds, and ſhew the meaneſt and ſafeſt way to heal them, as Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and Experience bears witneſs.</p>
                  <p>All Wounds in the head are dangerous, commonly they bring death along, by reaſon of the many and heavy ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms they are ſubject unto: as there is the Cramp, arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106818:42"/> or Palſie, Apoplexie, and many more, and eſpecially are they dangerous, when the pan or ſcull is broken, and more dangerous are they, when the skin of the brain is hurt and wounded, and moſt dangerous it is, when the brain is toucht, as it fals out ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore a Surgeon ought to be the more careful, and the wounded alſo muſt not be wanting to himſelf. For where wood and field, as they ſay, hold together, commonly a good year comes after, Therefore the Patient muſt be ruled by the Surgeon, and though the meanes uſed are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rough, yet he ought to conſider, that <hi>Malus nodus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum requirit caneum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Surgeon is to obſerve, that he govern the Patient with a good diet, as the condition of the Wound requireth, as you heard in the precedent Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Touching his ſpeaking, the Patient ought to be as ſparing in it as poſſibly may be, and if he ſpeaks, let him ſpeak ſoftly, and the room he lieth in muſt be kept quiet and ſtill. And the Surgeon muſt place the Patient orderly in his lying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the Wound is dangerous, then the Patient muſt be ruled, and lie ſtill in his bed, lie high, even as if he were ſitting, the higher the better, and that for reaſons well known, and the chamber muſt be kept dark for quietneſs ſake.</p>
                  <p>If a wounded party be brought unto you, dreſs him quickly thus: Cut off the hair round about the Wound, in caſe the Wound bleedeth much, that the bloud may the ſooner be ſtenched, and danger of death be prevented: the hair being cut off, ſtench the bloud with Cotten-wool, or with lints, as you ſhall hear hereafter, and then dreſs and bind him as it is the faſhion.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe the Wound doth not bleed (as it fals out ſometimes) or onely weepeth, then there is no need of bloud-ſtenching, but lay a Head-plaiſter to it, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an Opodeldoch, ſo that the Wound be covered broad and well every way, and then lay a ſoft bolſter upon, and bind it that it do not fall off. All this muſt be done quick and nimbly, that not much of the air come, whereby incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106818:42"/> ſoon is cauſed, if the dreſſing of the Wound be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed.</p>
                  <p>And the Surgeon ought to dreſs the party in a cloſe chamber, eſpecially at the ſecond dreſſing, to keep out the air, becauſe air endangers the Wound, as you heard already; the chamber alſo muſt be warm, according to the years ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for cold is hurtful to the Patient, cauſing Cramps, the which to prevent, let his neck and back bone be annointed with warm oyl, as with Cammomil oyl, and ſuch like, at the ſeveral dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>Touching the bands; bind it not too hard, and keep meaſure herein, as you ought in all other things. But if it be a very dangerous Wound, it needs be dreſſed but once a day the two firſt dayes, after that you may dreſs it twice a day. But I approve but of one dreſſing a day, unleſs the matter come too much, then two dreſſings a day will ſerve.</p>
                  <p>Have a care you uſe not much the Seeker to ſearch in the Wound withall, to find out its depth, breadth and length; the Wound doth not brook with it, but deſireth a good and a ſhort work, for the reaſon alledged in its due place.</p>
                  <p>You ought not to ſtitch any Head-wound, becauſe it is <note place="margin">Seeking and ſtitching in Head-wounds is forbidden.</note> dangerous, whereby an inflammation and anger ſoon is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which will be of an ill conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Having dreſſed the Wound, and obſerved every thing well, then is it adviſeable, that in caſe the Wound did not bleed, the Patient be phlebotomized the next day. But if his Wound hath ſufficiently bled, then Phlebotomy may be forborn and delayed for a fitter time.</p>
                  <p>The bloud being ſtenched, and the Wound dreſſed, and ſtayed there its due time, then at the taking off the blood-ſtencher go as neatly and gently about it as poſſibly you may, that you move not the Wound to bleeding again, which a rough dealing would cauſe, when the bloud-ſtencher is taken out by force, which puts the healing by, and cauſeth worſe things. Therefore be careful, tender and gentle in the opening of the Wound.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe the ſcull and the brain is opened, then at the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106818:43"/> taking off the bloud-ſtencher be careful that nothing fall <note place="margin">Brain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> upon the brain, for that cannot brook the leaſt thing to lie upon it. Therefore if any thing be fallen in, be it but the ſmalleſt hair, it preſently fals on cleanſing it ſelf, and ſtriveth to caſt it out. But what pains, beatings, pantings it cauſeth to the Patients head, may eaſily be judged, for I am not able to expreſs his miſery. You muſt not uſe greaſie things to ſuch a Wound, alſo oyles, ointments, becauſe they do no good, for the reaſon quoted above. Therefore my adviſe is, not to uſe any Pouders, Waters, Oyles, Salves, which ſome do make and apply them to the Scull and the <hi>Dura mater:</hi> for I marvelled much, that in this particular Nature was not better regarded, whereas neither the ſcull nor the brain can endure any thing. For the moſt were of opinion, that things good for the head may be uſeful alſo for Head-wounds, if applied; like the Bore, who thought the Plaiſter, that ſhould be applied to the ſtomack without, would do better within, and ſo he ſwallowed it, and by his good beleif he was healed. Others would mend the matter, and mixed other things with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and poured it into the Wound, and dipt lint in it, and laid it to the Scull or <hi>Pia mater;</hi> all which in Head wounds, where the braines <hi>Dura mater</hi> is opened, are meer poyſon, whereby apparent dangers are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Therefore let none be deceived, that whether <hi>Pia mater</hi> be hurt or no to uſe ſuch like things; and have a care that nothing fall upon it.</p>
                  <p>And if you intend to make uſe of an Ointment beſides <note place="margin">Ointments Salves and Plaiſters uſed.</note> the Plaiſter, hoping it will do better, and diſpatch the cure the ſooner, then do thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, make ready fine, clean, white lint, and lay it into the Wound gently, not roughly, as they uſually do, nor to thruſt it in, nor deeper than the ſcull is, &amp; that the ends of ſuch lints do hang over the Wound, that they may with more eaſe be taken out again; upon theſe lints others may be laid of the ſame ſtuffe, which with the Ointment muſt be made wet, which is ſet down hereafter, but not too much, that nothing drop from it upon the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> then apply the Head-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon, and dreſs the Patient warm, covering him with a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106818:43"/> ſoft bolſter, and obſerve all things well which hither to have been ſpoken of, then doubtleſs with Gods help all will be well.</p>
                  <p>And being it happeneth commonly in Head-wounds, <note place="margin">How to deal wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h theſe ſplinters in Head-wounds.</note> that the Scull is wounded, and ſome bones are ſhattered, ſome whereof are quite looſe, and ſome do hang by a little, and ſome of them ſtick downwards on the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> and ſome of them are beaten quite into the brain. Here a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon hath need to regulate himſelf accordingly: no ſuch ſmall bone or ſplinter ought to be taken out, unleſs it be free and looſe; and are to be taken out very gently and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly: be not afraid, though they hang by a little and are not quite looſe, then go on in your Art as well as you learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Nature her ſelf will in time looſen thoſe ſplinters, and expel them in good time; and Nature muſt be aſſiſted here with vulnerary Potions, as you ſhall here of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>In caſe a ſplinter hangeth within the <hi>Cranium</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which may be known by a certain ſign, then you muſt <note place="margin">Splinters hanging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> look to it, by reaſon of the difficulty which is at hand. For when the brain raiſeth, as commonly it doth, then the brain toucheth ſuch down-hanging ſplinters, with raging and pricking, and maketh a ſhort time ſeem to be very long to the Patient: with this raging, beating and panting, <hi>Pia mater</hi> is often broke thorough, and the brain it ſelf hurt, upon which, nothing ſo ſure, as death doth enſue, or at leaſt a mortal Chronical Impoſthume. Therefore if by a ſign you can obſerve, that from within ſuch a ſhattered ſplinter hangeth downward, then take it out with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, as well as ye can, though ſome force be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In caſe you cannot come to the ſplinter, then you muſt make room to it, and expel evil with evil, thereupon cut the <note place="margin">In caſe the ſplinter cannot be come by.</note> hair cloſe round about the Wound, yet ſo, that none fall into the Wound, then cut that skin and ſcull croſs way, where that ſplinter lieth; looſen the skin off the ſcull, and then ſee, whether you can get it out without any further trouble. And if you cannot come near it that way, then you muſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106818:44"/> uſe a very ſharp inciſion knife, and take out that piece with the on-hanging ſplinter. But if you could ſee that little bone, then cut it off even with a ſharp knife. This is the ſhorteſt, ſafeſt and beſt way to deal upon ſuch like danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wounds: from hence we obſerve, that the ſcull being broken may eaſily be dealt withall with carving and cutting, becauſe in ſuch caſes there are alwayes certain rents at hand, ſo that the cutting goeth off eaſily from the hand: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe where theſe rents are not, then is it hard to deal with.</p>
                  <p>And when you obſerve, that from the ſcull ſome little bones are fallen upon the brains, and that the vulnerary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the plaiſter cannot drive it out, which is not done in haſte neither; then they may be taken out with the Core-tongues, and have a care that the <hi>Piamater</hi> be not laid hold on, and pull'd aſunder, which would cauſe a Palſie or Apoplexie.</p>

                  <p>This to prevent, as often as the Patient is dreſſed, to ſtroak them gently, and preſs that matter out at the Wound: with your Swathing-bands and Bolſters you muſt be ſo careful, that the matter be forced to come forth at the Wound.</p>
                  <p>It uſually fals out alſo in Head-wounds, that the skin loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeneth <note place="margin">The skin looſened from the bone.</note> off from the bone, and ſuch Biles grow there as you heard of now, where the bloud and matter gathereth, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106818:44"/> puts the Patient to miſerable pains, and that is eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for then the Patients eye-lids do ſwell, eſpecially when their riſing appeareth, which feeleth ſoft here and there in the head.</p>
                  <p>This muſt in time be remedied, elſe the bloud would ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into the eyes, which hardly or never will be gotten from thence; yea, the Patient would be in a deadly perill if it ſhould be delayed. Therefore remove theſe gathered mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in time, and drive them out at the Wound. And in caſe this matter would not yeeld unto this, then lance theſe Biles, and let the matter out, and heal them again without delay, that you cauſe no other trouble.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth ſometimes, that the ſcull by a heavy blow is bowed inward, and there happeneth a great Bile in that <note place="margin">How to help a bowed ſcul.</note> place, and that ſometimes is done without hurting or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the skin, and is congealed bloud beneath it; ſome have an open Wound, and ſome have the ſcull onely bowed without the skin broken, and ſometimes not without ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: In ſuch dangerous caſes a Surgeon may well look about him. For if the brains be cruſht, then all remedies are uſed in vain, nothing will help, though the ſcull could and ſhould be put to the right place, unleſs God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſtrengthen or put new ſtrengths into the Patient. Therefore I will be ſilentin ſuch caſes, and ſhew how others are to be dealt withal.</p>
                  <p>In this particular, moſt of the Surgeons ſay, that when ſuch a hollow and bowed ſcull comes to be cured, the ſame muſt be raiſed with a Screw, but of this Screw I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, becauſe it cauſeth ſplinters and more troubles, and I never found any good was done with it, which in this particular gave occaſion to me to ſtudy upon a better way, unto which (next God) I took Nature for my help.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch a caſe is brought to you to be cured, then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feel with your finger, whether there be any fraction or congealed bloud at hand, and ask the Patient whether he be prickt, or how he feeleth himſelf: if you find congealed bloud, then preſently lance the place, let the matter run out. For this muſt be a common rule unto you, as ſoon as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106818:45"/> you ſuſpect any thing under ſuch an inbow'd hole, be it bloud, a fracture, a little bone, a ſplinter, then with one cut you muſt lance it, to preſs out the matter, and to make vent. For ſuch holes are ſooner brought to right when they have vent and are cleanſed, then when they are ſhut up: and for that reaſon you muſt lance it, that you be the ſurer of the thing, elſe you will be forced to cut off ſuch hurts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſplinters or little bones, which come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt part of the ſcull, and ſo cauſe Impoſthumations, which at laſt muſt be cut up, together with a piece of the ſcull, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch caſes, as generally hath been ſaid in the precedent Chapter, where the ſcull is bowed, Phlebotomy muſt not be neglected, and that in both armes, as occaſion ſhall ſerve: uſe no greaſie things, as Oyles, Waters, Ointments, Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c. but the Wound muſt be kept dry; neither muſt the in-bowed ſcull be oppreſt with Cataplaſmes, or ſuch like Compounds, as ſome uſe to do. Onely ſtick to your Head-plaiſters, and apply them the thicker, that no air may get in: uſe no tents into ſuch open hurts, neither thruſt any thing into, with the Seeker, or any other Inſtrument. For beſides other incommodities which are cauſed thereby, as was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt part, the Scull is brought by that meanes to that paſs, that it will receive nothing, and muſt of neceſſity be ſhaved; which may well be omitted, if rightly proceeded in other things. However, not regarding the miſ-handling: it happeneth in ſome fals and blowes, that the skin goeth off from the bone, and will imbrace no more one another. Here of neceſſity you are forced with a ſharp knife to ſhave or to ſcrape the bones, that you may get unto a freſh bottom. But in caſe by feeling no more can be found or felt, but onely the hole or fall, then omitlancing; and uſe onely the Head-plaiſter, together with the vulnerary Potion, it will do well enough, and by the help of Nature, which is ready to help her ſelf, it will come to a good end.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Trepan, make no uſe of it, and let it not trouble you, though the ſcull be bowed; for the head is able to bear with that hollowneſs without any hurt or prejudice,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106818:45"/> becauſe a great hollowneſs and emptineſs is below it, and not filled. Onely good care muſt be had, that no ill ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms may fall into. Therefore Phlebotomize the party, and in the reſt follow the government of the curing the Wound. But in caſe the ſcull be in bowed very much, then open it with a ſharp knife, and at the holloweſt part, where it is deepeſt, raiſe it again with a convenient Inſtrument, and bring it into its due place, as well as poſſible it may be done.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the pan of the head or ſcull be forcibly bowed inwards, which the ſword at the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow could not riſe, and made a pit or hole, as you heard above, and the bloud ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleth there, in this caſe the skin, which roſe thus, muſt be inſtantly lanced, and let the bloud run out, then it will ſit down again and ſink, then you may eaſily feel, whether there be any fracture in the ſcull, or any ſplinter. It happeneth alſo at the lancing of ſuch deep pits or holes, that the skin doth not ſink, but remains as it is caſt up. In this caſe cut it with Siſers croſs way, then the heads skin will ſink again, and in a ſhort time after will heal to it.</p>
                  <p>In caſe at ſuch a blow or fall, where the ſcull is in-bowed, there be a Wound, then dreſs it, as hitherto you have heard, how Head-wounds are dreſſed.</p>
                  <p>And if there any bone be looſe, then take it out, but in caſe it hangeth yet, and ſticketh inward, then raiſe it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again with an Inſtrument into his former place.

                  <p>Secondly, look well to theſe following ſignes; if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient complaineth of great pains, feels great prickings in the head, and theſe ſmarting pains increaſe more and more, and cannot endure to be toucht in that place where the Wound formerly was, yet no ſwelling nor riſing of the skin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, as you heard formerly, then is it a ſign, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſcull there is a ſplinter, which hangeth inward, and cauſeth theſe prickings; in this caſe that place muſt be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced inſtantly, and the ſplinter muſt be taken out, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In caſe the Patient complaineth more and more after the Cure, not onely of the place where he was cured, but all his head is panting and broyling, accompanied with extream pains. This is a ſign, that congealed bloud is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered under the ſcull, and is turned to an Impoſthume. And if his eyes be ſwelled, and ſome bloud and matter runs out of his noſtrils, then is it a more ſign of it.</p>
                  <p>This infirmity may, with Gods help, be cured eaſily, as hath been ſaid already: <hi>Viz.</hi> Cut off the hairs in the place where the pains are, lance the skin croſs way to the ſcull, in the breadth of half a Crown, and put back the four pieces, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106818:46"/> the ſcull be naked, then cut with a Raiſor or other Knife a Wound into the ſcull, open it, that you may look into it, then the matter will ſtart out againſt ye, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be eaſed; and if there be any ſplinter at hand, you may eaſily ſee it, and take it out, as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is the onely way to help ſuch a Patient. Such Wounds now made are ſoon healed again, onely govern the Patient well, as is fitting, and as I have informed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: You muſt lay nothing to his brains, as I told you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the brains will expel the things of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, when they have a vent for it, without any further help, and ſuffer not any ſtrange matter to ſtay or abide there.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cutting up of the ſcull, note, that there is <note place="margin">Note the cutting up of the ſcull.</note> no difficulty in it, and is done eaſily and quickly. For the ſcull gapeth and openeth, if there be any ſplinters or little bones there, therefore with a little help thoſe ſmall bones may be taken out; onely look narrowly to it, whether there be any fracture at hand, for you may eaſily diſcern, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſplinter within goeth down and inwards, or whether there be any more of congealed bloud there. But if you find after the opening of the skin, neither fracture nor ſciſſure, a hundred to one but there is, and however you are ſure, that the ſcull muſt be opened, be it either by reaſon of the congealed bloud, or by reaſon of an Impoſthume; take a well turn'd ſharp borer, and bore thorough the ſcull at the place where the pain is, then the matter will ſtartle out, and when the place is almoſt thorough bored, then work gently, and look well to it, that you cauſe no ſmall bones with the boring to fall into the hollow of the head, for if ſo, then you will find ſomewhat to do, and not without danger.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe ſome will have (though I never had need <note place="margin">Another way to open the ſcull.</note> of) that when the matter at the firſt opening doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then another hole, a fingers bredth from the firſt, is to be bored, and then to cut both theſe holes into one, and ſo to make a Wound into the ſcull: into that made hole you may ſee with a lighted candle in a dark place, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106818:47"/> the cauſe; if you find then either congealed bloud or a ſwelling, then touch it onely a little with an Inſtrument, as ſoon as it feeleth vent, it will ſoon come forth at the Wound. I ſhould like this way well enough, in caſe any ſplinter or looſe bones be there. But it is your duty to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in what manner it may be done moſt fitly and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, as the condition of the caſe requireth, and to regulate your ſelf accordingly. For it is impoſſible to ſet all down in writing, onely be mindful of the vulnerary potion, as you ſhall hereafter hear of.</p>
                  <p>Before the cloſe of this matter, I will tell you how you ſhall prepare the Head-plaiſters, and the thin ointment, ſo <note place="margin">To make Head-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> often mentioned hitherto.</p>
                  <p>Make the Head plaiſter thus: ℞ Of Wax ℥ 8. of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Turpentine <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 4. of oyl of Roſes ℥ 2. of the juyce of Bettony ℥ 6. put all theſe into a pan, let it boil, let all the joyce boil away, when the other are melted, then take it off the fire, and put thereto pulverized Colophonium ℥ ſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtix, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, of each half a drachm; this muſt be continually ſtirred, till it be ſo cold, that you may touch it with your hands, then work among it <hi>Oleum Storacis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitae</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs, make it up into rouls, and keep it clean for uſe.</p>
                  <p>This plaiſter cleanſeth Wounds, leaves no unclean thing in them, and is pleaſant and proper for the brains, and the whole head. Therefore uſe it as it ought, it will not deceive you, and doth better than Oyls, <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> Waters, Salves, as you heard above.</p>
                  <p>I will teach you another Head plaiſter, which is yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>℞ Wax lb 1, Turpentine ℥ 6. melt theſe together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well heated, pour it into Roſe water, let it cool; take it <note place="margin">Another Head-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> out and melt it again, and look that the Roſe water come all away: afterward take of pulverized Sanicle ℥ 1. and ſtray it into the melted Wax, and then all theſe following pieces; Frankincenſe, Maſtix, Myrrh, <hi>ana</hi> ℈ 1. prepared Calmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ℥ 2. <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> or prepared <hi>Bole armoniack,</hi> ℥ ſs all which muſt be purely beaten and ſtrayed into: take it off
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106818:47"/> the fire, and ſtir it continually till it be cold; then take it out of the pan, and work it with Cammomil oyle, make it into roules, and then into cakes, and keep them for uſe.</p>
                  <p>Touching the thin Head ſalve, make it thus:</p>
                  <p>℞ Hart Suet ℥ ſs purely skimm'd Honey ℥ ſs Aloes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick <note place="margin">Head-oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſalve.</note> purely beaten <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1. melt the Suet, ſtir the Honey and Aloes among it till it be cold, then you have a pure ſubtile Salve for the head; at the uſing of it, ſpread a little of it on a linnen, and apply it to the Wound; take heed that nothing of it fall on the brain, which can endure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Theſe are the Receipts I impart unto you.</p>
                  <p>Let it not be ſtrange unto you, that I ſet down no more <note place="margin">Many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts cauſe errors.</note> Receipts, which I could eaſily do. But to what end are pluralities of Receipts good for, but to confound him that is to make uſe of them, inſomuch that he knoweth not which to chuſe, or which to truſt moſt unto. A Receipt which is approved is better than a thouſand which prove falſe. He that is well grounded in Surgery will find Receipts enough in his daily practiſe. For the Art conſiſteth as well in the knowledge of Simptoms, as in the knowledge of Simples. He that well knoweth theſe two, will ſoon compoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, either to weaken or to ſtrengthen them in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and all according to the condition of the Wound.</p>
                  <p>Thus much be ſaid of the Head-wounds. Touching the Cramp and other accidents in Head-wounds, the ſame ſhall be ſhewed unto the Reader in its due place.</p>
                  <p>Now I will ſet down ſome examples of Head-wounds, which, through Gods help, have been ſtrangely cured; as I have copied them out of my Fathers writing, after his death.</p>
                  <p>I have, ſaith he, had occaſion to dreſs one by night in all haſte, becauſe he did bleed ſo much, that I was afraid he would die under my hands before I could dreſs him. For from his ſcull was cut off a great part, hair, skin, bone and all clean away, and then on the left ſide by the temple a great piece was cut off, skin, bone and all was gone: this Wound
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106818:48"/> looked ſo ghaſtly, that I was amazed at it, for it did bleed ſo vehemently, and it was ſo great, that I could not cover it with my hand. I dreſſed it in haſte thus: I covered the Wound with Mullipuffs, and bound it with broad Swathing-bands, and did no more to it, for I thought no other, but the Patient would die under my hands; I was forced to make all the haſte I could, and had no time to cut the hair away about the Wound. The next day taking off the uppermoſt rouler, there I found the lint mullipuff ſtick cloſe to the Wound, which I let alone, and poured round about warmed oyl of Roſes, with ſome of that oyl alſo I annointed the Patient his neck and back bone, and ſo I dreſſed him again: At the next dreſſing I took off no more of that Wool, but that which eaſily came off, and daily I annointed his back with Cammomil oyl warm'd. I dreſſed him ſtill in a dark ſtill chamber, where no air ſhould fall on his brain; and I had a care alſo, that none of my breath came into the Wound, and the things I intended to uſe to the Wound I had in readineſs, that he in the dreſſing might not be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Patient was well governed in his diet, and quiet, according to order. The lint together with the bloud came purely off from the Wound; but the brain began to ſwell, and in the outſide the ſcull opened, where the brain preſſed thorough all along, which a knife might have taken off, and it did pant and work, as if it would come forth and change his place, which it did more in the neather Wound, than in the upper, where the brain was not touched. To all which I did nothing, but dreſſed the Wound with the wound-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter three doubled, ſo that no air might come to it. At the tenth day the upper Wound inclined to healing, and the brains began to ſettle by little and little, and grew ſo little, that I could have laid a finger betwixt the ſcull and the brain, thus empty grew the head. And the brain ſinking thus, I ſpied a little thing lying on the brain, which was not quite ſeparated, in the reſt it was wholly pure: on the <hi>Pia mater</hi> there began to grow fleſh, which grew bigger and bigger; I wondered, that in few dayes there could grow ſo much fleſh: but where that ſaid impure ſplinter did lie,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106818:48"/> there it ſtunk extreamly, and would not come to any heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at laſt the ſaid ſplinter began to ſtir to and fro in the Wound, with a ſubtile linnen I took off nimbly as much as would ſtick to the cloth, the reſt which clung not to the cloth I left there, for I ſtill was afraid that he would die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hands, though the twenty eight day was paſt already. At laſt I thruſt that little ſplinter away alſo, ſo that I could ſee what was beneath it. There I found (there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent many honourable perſons) that the brain was hurt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, of the breadth of half a fingers joynt; in that place there was alwayes a moiſture, as often as it was wiped away, preſently another came into the place, and the fleſh in it round about looked no other than like a raw Wound, in which there lieth a ſplinter, which hinders the healing of it: it grew thicker and thicker and ſoft, that I marvelled at it; yet it would never cover that place where the brain was hurt. At laſt when the fleſh encreaſed, in one night it covered that place wholly, ſo that I ſaw no more moiſtneſs, onely ſome matter lay there, And thus the whole head grew up with fleſh, and I ſuffered the fleſh above the ſcull to grow out, and hindered it not, for here his ſcull could not be metled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Now ſuffering this fleſh to overgrow, then I ſtraid in that fleſh round about burnt Allum, but none into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, for there he could endure none. Afterward the fleſh preſſed forth at the Wound and ſcul ſo faſt, that it drove out ſome little bones that were looſe in the Wound, at which I wondered not a little, that ſo many ſmall bones ſhould come forth out at the Wound, At laſt he was cured of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Wound, and the fleſh was good and ſound, and not ſoft (as commonly it is:) for the which he owed thanks to God, without whoſe gracious help ſuch remarkable cures cannot be performed; and not every one riſeth ſound from his bed of ſuch heavy Wounds.</p>
                  <p>Hereto ſerveth this enſuing example alſo, that every one may ſee, that nothing ought to be laid upon the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> and the <hi>pia Mater,</hi> becauſe Nature in that particular work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth better, than any Surgeon may perform with his Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106818:49"/>
                  <p> In the Juriſdiction of <hi>Bern</hi> it happened, that one received <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a ſplinter.</note> a Wound in the head, where the ſcull to the eye ſeemed not hurt, becauſe his Surgeon dawbed it up in haſte: But ten dayes after the Patient began to complain, every day more and more, till at laſt he could have no reſt: it was time then to ſend for a Surgeon; among the reſt I was called; after conſultation had over the condition of the Patient, I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſcul, at the opening of it there ran out much bloud and matter; three dayes after within the ſcull there was a ſplinter about the breadth of a finger, where I had much ado before I could take it out, without further enlarging of the Wound; at laſt being taken out, the Patient preſently was at eaſe, and inclined to healing, and was fully recovered from this accident.</p>
                  <p>I muſt quote one more: In the younger dayes of my travelling for to get experience, at <hi>Nurnberg</hi> I met with an <note place="margin">Another example.</note> acquaintance, being a Student, this Schollar was wounded on his head by a Cuttler with an old blade, and was dreſſed by the City Barber-Surgeon, who had good experience, and the Wound ſeeming little to the eye was ſoon cured, and both parties thought all had been well. Now hear what happened: ten dayes after the Patient ſickneth upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, grew very weak in the head, feeling extream pains in that place where the Wound was, and before he could be helped he died. After his death his head was opened, to know the cauſe of his ſudden death, it was found juſtly, as you have heard in the former example.</p>
                  <p>Theſe examples I thought to quote, and no more; for if theſe are not underſtood, ſurely others will not be neither, though I ſhould quote hundreds, and if theſe be underſtood, then in ſuch like cauſes Surgeons have ſufficient advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby they may regulate themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may take notice by theſe, that in Head-wounds I uſe no Balſams, no Salves, no Oyles, no Head-powder, nor any ſuch like thing, name it what you will: And ſtick onely to the Head-plaiſter, but ſo, that it may be laid over the Wound, after the manner of an Opodeldoch, there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Whole Art and advantage; and if you uſe it in this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106818:49"/> manner, you effect more therewith, than with all other Salves, Oyles, Balſams, Pouders, that may be found in all <hi>Europe.</hi> For if you apply theſe Plaiſters rightly, according unto Art, then the Patient will be well, not onely in his head, but alſo in his whole body; it draweth all heat out of the Wound, and bringeth broken bones and matters better out of the Wound, than any tongs can pull it out; it covereth the Wound in ſuch a manner, that no air can get in upon the brain, nor can any vapour get out, which fitteth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Head-wounds exceedingly. Therefore if you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this order, you will perform more than all thoſe, which dance after the old pipe and fiddle, as it is apparent among the <hi>Italians, French, Spaniſh,</hi> and others: What a miſerable thing is it amongſt them, if they have in hand but a ſmall Wound in the head? How many die in that way, by reaſon of their old abuſes? I confeſs, the hot Climate in thoſe parts may occaſion ſomewhat. They write ſuch great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, of this and that, and ſo confidently, that even to this day they know not what to do, and yet they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that others muſt beleive and learn of them. I have been preſent more than once, that Patients were poſſeſt with heat, feavers, dryneſs, yea, the great heat took away quite their ſenſes; and there were uſed all kind of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, Gliſters, Purges, Potions, Coolers, but all would not help. But after I had applied my Plaiſter in the ſaid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they mended, and without the uſe of any other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, all pain, anger and heat was gone: from thence I could well obſerve, that their dangerous binding and dreſſing was the onely cauſe of all theſe miſchiefs: and I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſay, that I have found the ſafeſt and fitteſt manner, and the beſt, to dreſs Head-wounds. In new Wounds much groaping and ſeeking is nought: I do not ſpeak this by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, but knowingly and experimentally. For if you touch too hard new fleſh, which is but newly grown, it bleedeth preſently, and ſeparateth again: therefore have a care when you intend to cover a bone in the head, for if you do but touch hard the borders and outſides of ſuch Wounds, they turn blew and go aſunder, and will not ſo eaſily cloſe again
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106818:50"/> or unite. Therefore you muſt take heed, to commit any fault that way, for after it hath been touched, it never cloſeth ſo eaſily again.</p>
                  <p>Thus I will cloſe the relation of theſe perillous Head-wounds, hoping you will behave your ſelf well, both in ſlight and dangerous Head-wounds; and therefore I will write no more of the ſlight Head-wounds: Much more could be ſaid, how the cauſes of ſuch miſchiefs ought to be judged; but theſe are the chiefeſt things, which may lead you to the knowledge of the reſt.</p>

In this Chapter I will treat of the whole Face, of the Forehead, Temples, Eares, Eyes, Noſe, Cheeks and Chin.</p>
                  <p>Touching Wounds in the Forehead, theſe are to be dreſſed <note place="margin">Wounds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Temple-wounds are more troubleſome, becauſe they bleed more, and are ſubject to more ſimptoms than thoſe in the Forehead, yet are cured like thoſe of the Head; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I direct the Reader; onely theſe muſt be kept very warm.</p>
                  <p>Note, that on the Temple is a ſinew, which if that be cut, <note place="margin">Temple-Wound.</note> it cauſeth lameneſs in the jaw bone, which hardly, or not at all will be able to ſtir, which to prevent, let the Patient gape ſometimes as wide as ever he can.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106818:50"/>
                  <p> Wounds on the Noſe and Ears are cured all one way; if <note place="margin">Noſe-wounds. Ear-wounds.</note> they hang downward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, then let them have one, two or three ſtitches, and the ſtitches muſt be made even, and take heed you make not too many ſtitches; when theſe begin to hold the fleſh, then cut the ſtitches out again, and not let them rot there, which would cauſe ghaſtly ſcarrs, and keep theſe Wounds well together with roulers, becauſe they are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Such Wounds heal freely, though they hang but at a little piece.</p>
                  <p>But if a Noſe or Ear is altogether grown cold at the ſtitching, be not amazed, but ſtitch it on, and warm it with warmed Wine, in which is laid Sanicle, or Houſleek, and being well heated, then apply it, afterward dreſs it like a ſoft Wound, and being healed to a skin, then let a ſcurfe grow upon, it will heal the Noſe finely.</p>
                  <p>Wounds on Chins heal eaſily and freely, if they be not cut downward, and need no ſtitching; but if a flap hangs <note place="margin">Chin-wounds.</note> down, then ſet two ſtitches. But, as was ſaid by the Noſe and Ear-wounds, to prevent ugly ſcarrs, which ſtitches uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leave behind, let them be ripped up again. Plaiſters which cling hard ought not to be laid to Chin-wounds, whereby the tender and young healing would be broken again at the taking off the plaiſter. No great advantage to be uſed at the healing of ſuch Wounds, being they are of a free healing; Wound-waters made of Honey and Wine are of good uſe for ſuch Wounds.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the jaw bone be diſplaced by a blow, it ought firſt of all to be put in the right place; ſuch Wounds, by reaſon <note place="margin">Cheek-wounds.</note> of the jaws conſtant motion, do heal very hardly, not ſo eaſie as thoſe in the Cheeks. Uſe no greaſie things to theſe Wounds, which would cauſe naughty fleſh, if not quite a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulo; the manual herein is, to let the cure reſt on a good ſtrong Wound-plaiſter, which will do it: Apply that Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter warm and well covered, and let the Patient gargarize twice or thrice a day, as occaſion ſerveth: With this ℞. Of Wine lb 1. of Water lb 4. of Oak leaves ℥ 1. burnt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom 31 white, Vitriol 3 ſs. Mingle theſe, let it have a ſtrong walm. This Gurgariſme, if the ſooner uſed,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106818:51"/> keeps off proud fleſh, and ſuffers no thing to grow in the Wound.</p>
                  <p>This following Wound-water is to be uſed alſo: ℞ Of <hi>Couſolida major,</hi> Oak leaves, <hi>ana</hi> M 2. boyl theſe in two quarts of Water, boyl ſome part of it away, let it cool, let the Patient waſh his mouth with it luke-warm, and he will be healed quickly.</p>
                  <p>No Coolers are uſed to Eye-wounds made of the white of Eggs, as uſually they do; neither is Turnip water good, <note place="margin">Eye-wounds.</note> which would make the Eyes ſore, which abuſe is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I have known ſome, which held themſelves great Surgeons, who held it for a great Maſter-piece, to outrun the Eye in a ſhort time, and kill the heat therein. But this is a horrible skill to ſpoil folks eye ſight; theſe men little think upon Nature, and how little do they regard her help. Better wayes are to be conſidered of, for the Eye-wounds are very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>To uſe cooling things, and to apply them outwardly, is adviſeable ſome way, and I intend to deſcribe ſomething al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

                  </p>
                  <p>If a party hath received a Wound in the Eye apple, or the Eye hath received ſome other Wound, then in the firſt place note, that wounded Eyes muſt have drying things, and ſo the Medicaments muſt be made accordingly. The metalline ones (of whom hereafter) I hold to be the beſt. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, I will conceal nothing, but faithfully impart that which I found experimentally.</p>
                  <p>If an Eye be wounded, this is the Secret, I know, and is of <note place="margin">A Secret for wounded Eyes.</note> great uſe in many other caſes.</p>
                  <p>℞ Virgins Honey, which of its own accord is fair and clear, and need not to be more clarified, lb ſs. mingle with it the juyce of freſh red Roſes ℥ 4. pulveriſed white Vitriol ℥ ſs. Verdigreice ℥ ¼. put all theſe in a glaſs body, diſtill it in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> you receive two waters, the firſt and the laſt, this laſt is the better of the two; of theſe waters you may ſafely drop two drops into the Eye. Afterward take one part of this water, and the mucilage of Foenugreek, <hi>ana,</hi> break to it the yolk of an Egg, beat theſe well together, warm it a little, ſpread it on a doubled cloth, apply it to the Eye, all pains will be gone at the third or fourth application, and will come to healing.</p>

Some uſe alſo Gum Tragant, and Gum Arabick, with Henbane. Dayly experience will produce more and better things than may now be written: if you apply this ſlimy plaiſter, firſt moiſten the wounded place with oyle of Roſes and blew Violets, that the plaiſter may not ſtick to the skin, that afterward you need not to take it off forcibly,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106818:52"/> eſpecially when great anger is therein. Take heed, that of this plaiſter nothing come into the Eye, though it be no hurt, but onely biteth. The heat and anger being removed, then the next and beſt that I know, is the red oyle of Ceruſe, drop two or three drops into the eye, and round about the outſide annoint the place with the white oyl of Ceruſe, it is a marvellous healer and true metalline cooler, clarifying the eyes, and preventing other ſimptoms. This is generally uſed for the eyes, and found never a better. And with theſe onely, by Gods help, I undertake to heal ſwelled, beaten and wounded Eyes and eye-lids, though they be never ſo much bloudſhed, and full of congealed bloud.</p>
                  <p>How is the oil of Ceruſe made?</p>
                  <p>With diſtilled Vinegar. The red oil, which I commend ſo much, is made thus:</p>
                  <p>℞ Ceruſe lb 1. well grinded, pour on it diſtilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gartwice drawn; the firſt running is put by, and the laſt, as the ſtrongeſt, onely taken, lb 3. boil theſe together for half an hour, and then ſet it in a warm place for three or four dayes; then put it in a coated Retort, ſet it in the open fire, let your firſt fire be gentle, and draw all the Vinegar into a Receiver; which being done, then increaſe the fire ſo long, till you ſee red drops coming, which muſt be received a part, and ſtill increaſe the fire ſo long, till nothing comes. Its true, you will get little enough, but as little as it is, as great vertue and efficacy it hath, not onely in the Eye ſimptoms. but alſo in other things, which in its due place ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
                  <p>I know theſe things, according to this proceſs, may not be had every where, and in caſe theſe things could not be had timely enough, then other things, as good as they, may be had, muſt be uſed; for in caſe of neceſſity, means preſent are not to be refuſed, and I allow of them, if ſo be the Eyes be not killed, or otherwiſe ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place note, in caſe the eye-lids hang over they muſt be ſtitched.</p>
                  <p>A certain Merchant was cut over the Noſe, and one of his Eye apples was hurt alſo, that Wound was croſs the ſtarre.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106818:52"/> That party, next God, was helped onely with this red oil of Lead, or Lethargir.</p>
                  <p>Another party received a ſplinter of wood in his Eye, where it ſtuck two grains deep in, this oil onely recovered his Eye.</p>
                  <p>Another party ſpoiled his Eye unawares with a ſharp wood, a Surgeon made experiment on him with the white of Eggs and Bole, whereby the Eye was killed, and when there was no more hope left, half the Eye was looſened, and the skin of it wrinkled. To the party I, being called, uſed my Medicine you heard of, and put of the red oil into the Eye, he preſently felt eaſe, and the eye was perfectly cured, but onely it was not ſo clear, and a ſpot ſtaid in it, and I am perſwaded, if I had been with him at firſt, I could have cured his Eye without defect.</p>
                  <p>For good men and womens ſake, I will teach you how <note place="margin">To heal Wounds, not leaving a ſcarr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</note> Wounds are healed, and leave no ſcar to be ſeen in the face or any where, or elſe they ſhall hardly be diſcerned, Here I except ſuch Wounds that were ſtitched, and where the bones were ſhattered, and where veins and ſinews are hurt: I ſpeak onely of ſuch, either great or ſmall, Wounds in the face or elſewhere, that are not very deep, and where the skin onely is broken.</p>

Whilſt the body ſtandeth in Balneo, apply cold wet clouts to the head, and another clout on the Receiver, that the ſpirits of Wine may cool, and reſolve into drops.</p>
                  <p>At the uſing of it, take the ſingle threeds or ravellings of linne, wet them in this Water, cleanſe the Wounds with them, let it lie in the Wounds, lay a fine ſoft boulſter on it, and bind the Wound cloſe that no air come into it, thus

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the Wounds in the Head and Face, follow the Wounds in the Neck and Throat, of them I will treat now: Here, as I have told you before, <hi>I</hi> do not ſpeak of ſlight and ſmall Wounds, but of dangerous ones, where partly the great bloud veins are hurt, when the ſinews of the Neck, and the Wind-pipe, or the like is wounded; my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhall be according to theſe, hoping that he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who can heal ſuch Wounds, may heal alſo thoſe which are leſs dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of theſe two ſorts of Wounds, firſt note, <note place="margin">Neck and Throat-wounds are dangerous.</note> that theſe are very perillous, and ſubject to all manner of ſimptoms, by reaſon of the exceeding great pain; and ſuch things are incident, <hi>viz.</hi> Cramp, Palſie, Apoplexie, Wound-conſumption, and ſuch like, and ſo they muſt the more wiſely be dealt withal: and <hi>I</hi> will give a particular inſtruction of each Wound, becauſe there is ſome diſtinction to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in the firſt place <hi>I</hi> will ſpeak of the Neck-wounds.</p>
                  <p>As I have informed you formerly, that as I do not mean <note place="margin">Neck-woudds.</note> here any ſlight Wound, ſo on the other ſide you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I mean not ſuch Wounds, where all the Neck is in pieces, for ſuch Wounds ſurely bring death along, and are incurable. But here I ſpeak of all ſuch Wounds, when the Neck is hurt grievouſly.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that the Neck dependeth from the Back bone,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106818:53"/> and hath great affinity with the Brains, out of whoſe hinder part runneth a marrow along, like a rivelet through the Neck and Back bone. Therefore all what I tell you here of the Wounds of the Neck, the ſame you muſt take alſo for the Wounds of the Back bone, for theſe are cured all one way. Therefore the things ſpoken of above may be drawn hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as you have heard above, you ought not to <note place="margin">Neck-wounds ought not to be ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> ſtitch Wounds in the Neck, nor to put a tent into, much leſs ought you to ſearch and to ſound them with any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how deep and how large theſe Wounds are, whether ſtabb'd or cut; do not ſound them, let the depth be what it will, never trouble them, elſe you cauſe all manner of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and dangerous ſimptoms, and ſo you make the laſt worſe than the firſt was.</p>
                  <p>Proceed thus: Firſt ſtench the bloud, as you ſhall hear; <note place="margin">The true proceeding.</note> and having removed the Bloud-ſtencher, then take a good Wound-ointment, which you ſhall find deſcribed in its due place in the Chapter of Wound-ſalves; make it luke-warm and pour it into the Wound, then apply a good plaiſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be it a ſtiptick one, or an Opodeldoch, and cover it with a defenſive Plaiſter made of Beans, which muſt guard the Wound round about. This Plaiſter, when there is great pain at hand, muſt be applied freſh ſeveral times. Have a care, that the lowermoſt Medicaments, which lay next the wound, do not cling and ſtick to the defenſive plaiſter; therefore betwixt the lowermoſt and the other lay a cloth, on which do ye reſt the defenſive Plaiſter. But in caſe the Wound be not pained, then there is no need of the Defenſive Plaiſter, becauſe it doth not alwayes good. Annoint then the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with warmed oyls of Cammomil, of Roſe oyl, mixed with a little Saffron, or annoint the Patient round with Gray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s greaſe, his Neck, and Back bone, and the Wound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and look carefully to the buſineſs. Govern the party in his diet, as you were told at the Head-wounds. Keep him from cold and air, and let him be quiet, and not ſtir much, and be temperate in eating and drinking. You may apply alſo to his Wound a Sandel plaiſter, which I call the red San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106818:54"/> plaiſter: with theſe things you proceed in the cure, till you come to a perfect healing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wounds being very ſubject to ſimptoms, and among <note place="margin">Note the ſigns by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, as Cramp, joynt water.</note> the reſt to the joynt-water, which in the whole body is no where ſo dangerous, as it is about the Neck and Throat, eſpecially when a Cramp fals into, therefore you have cauſe to look the better to it, and to prevent ſuch accidents. But how you muſt behave your ſelf, touching the joynt and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new water, and againſt the Cramp alſo, with the brown Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ſhall find direction for it in the third part of this Book, or elſe in ſome other place.</p>
                  <p>Touching Throat-wounds, theſe you muſt trouble as little <note place="margin">Throat-wounds.</note> with Tents, and with the Seeker, as the other in the Neck.</p>
                  <p>Proceed thus: If you have a Throat-wound in cure, <note place="margin">True pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note> where the bloud iſſueth forth mainly, ſo that there is fear that a bloud vein hath been hurt, or that the ſwallow and Throat be cut, then note, if the Wound or Stab be deep or ſhallow, neer the Ear, then you may ſtitch it, but not ſlightly, as commonly is done, but muſt be drawn ſtrongly together croſs-way, ſo that neither breath nor bloud can get out, then apply to the Wound an Opodeldoch, with a defenſive plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon, which is deſcribed alſo in its due place; this do ſo long till the anger be paſt.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn the Wound together with that ſtitching, then is it requiſite, that you have a good Medicine, which penetrate with its vertue, and that is the Magnetick plaiſter, which is deſcribed in Books of Decoctions, truly that will draw all matter; you need not to uſe any other thing to the Wound, but onely apply this plaiſter great and thick. Let it not trouble you, which way the matter in theſe wounds goeth; for Throat-wounds afford not much corruption, and the Opodeldoch is of that quality, that it leaveth not much uncleanneſs behind. If the Wound be great and wide, ſo that you fear it may not be ſtitch'd that way, then let it alone, for common ſtitches will not hold in this caſe, and keep in the bloud from iſſuing forth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make uſe of a Bloud-ſtencher, and proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you did with other perillous Wounds; and if you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106818:54"/> uſe any plaiſters hereto, then ſpread it thick, that the air may preſs the leſs thorough; for the ſwallow is a ſubſtance which can endure no air at all. But if the throat be hurt at the ſide, then do not ſtitch it, eſpecially if the Wind-pipe or ſwallow be in pieces, for if a ſwelling ſhould be incident, the patient will be choaked, or periſh in his food.</p>
                  <p>And if the Wound be not great or deep, then do not ſtitch it, and draw much fleſh into, it would cauſe an ugly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt ſcarr.</p>
                  <p>For at the Throat uſually happen groſs ſcarrs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of many ſtitches there, and of too much fleſh, and if-you can, endeavour to heal it up to a ſcurfe, for if you ſuffer the fleſh to grow freely and high, then the ſcarr will be as big as a great nut, therefore be not neglective in the preventing the ſimptom betimes, elſe it may be too late to undertake the oppoſing of it; you ought not to put into the Wound any Salve, oyl, or Tent, for it may as little endure any Tent as the Back bone, by reaſon of the variety of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news which are in the Throat,</p>
                  <p>It being a thing more uſual in Throat-wounds, that ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <note place="margin">Gargariſm.</note> are incident, whereby ſoon great ſorrows and troubles are cauſed, therefore is it requiſite, that there be uſed, beſides the defenſive Plaiſter, a Gargariſm, not onely the ſooner to further the healing of the Wound, but to aſſwage alſo the pains. And if there be not heat at hand, then take Wine, elſe do you take Water lb 3. put one hand of Mallow ſeed, boil a third part away, which being done, then ſtrain it through a clean cloth, put thereto of Honey ℥2. boyl it again, after you ſcummed it put it in a pewter diſh, put to it of <hi>Storax Calamintha</hi> ℥ ¼ and ſo let it ſtand for your uſe. Some add a little Cinnamon, which cannot be amiſs. Let the Patient uſe this water ſeveral times a day, it will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly further the healing, but eaſe him of his pain, and keep off rheumes. This Gargariſm may ſafely be uſed alſo in Head-wounds, and is effectual alwayes.</p>
                  <p>Touching the joynt-water, when that commeth, then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">If the joint-water com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106818:55"/> then take notice of the cauſes and ſigns thereof, that you may know whether the Prunella or inflammation be either at hand or coming on, and if it doth ſignifie the Wound ſickneſs, or any other thing, then proceed as you ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>All ſuch that are troubled with ſuch deep Neck and <note place="margin">If a heat comes.</note> Throat-wounds, and endure great pains, then uſe ſmarting plaiſters, it will eaſe them.</p>
                  <p>One thing more; in caſe the Patient feeleth great heat, either in the Head, or in the Face, and by reaſon of it feareth the Prunella, the Wound-ſickneſs, or other ſuch like, then phlebotomize the Patient chiefly under the Tongue, if it may conveniently be; for ſuch phlebotomy cooleth much both Head and Throat, taking away all the heat, quencheth thirſt, oppoſeth many ſimptoms, and maketh the Wound for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto healing; therefore neglect not Phlebotomy in theſe Wounds, if need, not elſe. Theſe veins you may ſafely open in Head-wounds where any heat is felt, ſurely it will not be fruitleſs.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>TO ſpeak of Breaſt-wounds, I mean not ſmall ſlight Wounds, which require no ſingular great cure, being <note place="margin">Of Breaſt-wounds.</note> without danger. By Breaſt-wounds I underſtand the firſt part of the Ribs. If a party be wounded there, and the Wound is not gone through the body, then no great danger to be feared; and upon that you ought to deal, as uſually is done to common Wounds. For thoſe Wounds, which deeply run into the body, are very dangerous. It fals out in ſuch wounds, that the ſtab doth not go deep into the wound, and yet one of the inner members is wounded. Sometimes a party is run quite thorough, and yet no internal part wounded. Let the condition of the Wound be what it will,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106818:55"/> you muſt note firſt, a party being wounded at the Breaſt, commonly there cometh a wind out of the Wound, which is like unto mans breathing; here you muſt have a care, for that is from thence obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In caſe an internal part is wounded, then there is a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable ſign accompanied withit. For if the Lungs, or the <note place="margin">Signs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts wounded.</note> Midriffe, which diſtinguiſheth the Lungs from the Breaſt, is wounded, then is the Patient troubled with a continual cough, and there appeareth a ſcum in the Wound, and the Patient is full of pains, and can hardly fetch breath: if the heart be wounded, then no remedy expected, of which I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, for the party dieth preſently, for no Art nor care will avail here, however be not wanting on your ſide, dreſs his Wound as Wounds of Lungs uſually are dreſt.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame conditions are other internal wounded parts. And in caſe the party be quite run thorough, without hurt to the internal parts, yet that Wound is to be judged and undertaken as perillous and mortal. For though none of <note place="margin">Back-wounds are a cauſe of lame mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> the inward parts be hurt, yet it may be, that that thruſt hath hit ſome of the white veins or ſinews on the back, which is dangerous, by reaſon of the affinity they have with the Heart. It happeneth many times, that when a party is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Back, that he fals lame, either in his hand, arme, or elſewhere, where no defect at all was, which is cauſed onely by thoſe white veins that are hurt.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cure of ſuch Breaſt-wounds, I intend not <note place="margin">Breaſt-wounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Onely concerning the defenſive Plaiſter, that may here be omitted, unleſs the Back bone be run thorough alſo, and great pains are felt, cauſed by the hurt ſinews.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as I have informed you in Wounds of the Throat, what you ſhould do touching ſtitching, ſo you muſt <note place="margin">Stitching is permitted.</note> note here alſo, that Breaſt-wounds are to be ſtitched, and the ſtitches drawn ſtrongly together croſs-way, yea, you may uſe twiſted ſtitches, becauſe they go eaſily aſunder, by reaſon of the breathing which conſtantly is againſt it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are forced aſunder. And whereas breathing hinders
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106818:56"/> the vapours, and the air the healing, therefore the Wound muſt be ſtitched as cloſe as poſſible may be,</p>
                  <p>After that uſe no more but the green Salve, which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the healing, then lay the Magnetick plaiſter upon, and bind it quickly; care not what courſe the matter taketh, or which way the bloud runneth; for it ought not to have any vent, and may get perhaps more vent than the Surgeon ſhall well like of. Bind it well with warm clothes, but not too hot, elſe it would incline to a fiſtulo, neither uſe any Tents, and above all, ſearch not with the Iron in the Wound, which is a curſed cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the Wound be ſo great and ſo wide, that it cannot be drawn together and ſtitched, but it will keep ſome vent, <note place="margin">Stltching when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of.</note> then omit ſtitching altogether, becauſe ſuch ſtitches would break out and burſt aſunder, by reaſon of the breath, which if it hath but a little paſſage, it preſſeth more vehemently againſt the ſtitches, as when the Wound were more narrowly cloſed.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch Wounds uſe neither flat nor round tents, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in your Tent-ointment, and then lay your plaiſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">Take heed of flat and round tents</note> on; for the wounded parties breath being drawn, would ſtrongly draw alſo the Tent into the body, and the Patient would bring great miſery upon himſelf, and cauſe his own utter ruine, becauſe that indrawn Tent muſt lie on the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, or <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and rot there; and indeed no wick or tent is fit to be uſed in theſe Wounds.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that cold and warm dreſſing is dangerous, and <note place="margin">Cold and hot dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are dangerous.</note> hot dreſſing is more dangerous, becauſe it cauſeth infallibly a putrefaction, as experience ſheweth. For many ſuppoſe, that hot dreſſings and hot Medicaments were beſt, but the contrary enſued upon, as hath been known. Therefore a medium is beſt in all things, let it be neither too hot, nor too cold</p>
                  <p>If you undertake to cure a Wound which cannot be ſtitched, then uſe a ſtrong Bloud-ſtencher unto, as you heard <note place="margin">How to dreſs breaſt wounds that cannot be ſtitched.</note> above, and more of it followeth after; and at the taking off the Bloud-ſtencher, and at the dreſſing again, all neceſſary things you ought to have in readineſs, as I told you above,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106818:56"/> that the Wound be dreſt nimbly, that the parties breath may not paſs much thorough, which would be very hurtful. All this muſt be done in a dark place, and ſharp rough air be kept off. Have a great burning Candle by the hand, you ſhall <note place="margin">Air hurtful to the Wound.</note> ſee that the breath that cometh forth out of the Wound will blow out the Candle.</p>
                  <p>Hence you may gather, that ſuch Wounds are endangered if not quickly dreſſed; and a care muſt be had, that the Lungs draw not into the body the rough air, for if you ſuffer this to be done, the Patient will never be recovered. Breath, if it gets but a little paſſage, and is warm, it cauſeth moiſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, whereby are cauſed internal Fiſtuloes, and hot feavers, <note place="margin">Internal ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuloes, hot feavers.</note> with the loſs of underſtanding and ſenſe, and ſo all natural means loſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore uſe ſuch Plaiſters which ſtick and cling eaſily, and ſuffer not air to come by, and uſe ſuch ſtiptick Plaiſters in manner of an Opodeldoch, or uſe an Opodeldoch, which is very uſeful in ſuch caſes.</p>
                  <p>By theſe things may eaſily be gathered, that Cataplaſmes, <note place="margin">Cataplaſms of no uſe.</note> which in ſuch caſes are too much uſed, are uſeleſs altogether, for they are too weak, and have no power to oppoſe the air and breath, and beſides they are too moiſt, and ſo they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putrefactions.</p>
                  <p>I know, that there are many which will not like my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dreſſing, no more than I like other mens dreſſing: for ſome may object, ſaying, if a Wound in the ſaid manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Anſwer: For the taking off of this doubt, note: Dayly experience witneſſeth, that Breaſt-wounds, which can be thus ſtitched, have no where ſuch danger, as thoſe which cannot be ſtitched and it is known, that that which is inwardly hurt ſooner healeth, becauſe no air troubleth it, than that where the air cometh to it: For the air in the hollow of the body is judged mortall and deadly. Touching the bloud, which, you ſay, runs into the body, troubleth me little. For Nature, which alwayes endeavoureth to help her ſelf, turneth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106818:57"/> that bloud into water, which if good and fit means are uſed, may be expelled by ſweat and urine.</p>
                  <p>It may further be objected, Whether runs the matter? <note place="margin">Objections anſwered.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let not that trouble you, it is conſumed and expelled through the Opodeldoch, and further removed by ſtool, with the help of Medicaments. Where you may note alſo, that the Breaſt-wound being healed, looſen and thruſt off the ſtitches, and leave a paſſage, whereby the matter can paſs and run out. And before that is done, the Wound is well ſet and healed, and the fear is the leſs in that particular, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Patient be ſtill kept as he ſhould, as you heard above.</p>

                  <p>BReaſt-wounds have ſimptoms incident to them, more than other Wounds have, which in this place I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Breaſt-wounds have many ſimptoms.</note> in particular. For touching other common ſimptoms of Wounds, of them, in its place, you find ſufficient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>In the antecedent Chapter I have told you, that you ought <note place="margin">How to do when a tent is gotten into the wound or body.</note> not to uſe any Tents in Breaſt-wounds, nor any other ravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the like rags, for a reaſon alledged.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Surgeons found, who uſe their tents in an ignorant way and groſs miſtake, and put ſuch like things into Wounds, which afterward are ſucked in by the breath of the Patient into the Breaſt, and the Patient is thereby brought into extream danger. I have ſeen ſuch Patients, who having
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106818:57"/> drawn and ſuck'd ſuch tents into the body, dyed of it There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a care, that you uſe no flat and round tents untied, unleſs you guard them well; nor make any ſuch tents, as if you would heal therewith another hole: There is no need of any tent, but onely of a Salve and Plaiſter, and by a nimble and quick dreſſing keep out the wind, air and cold.</p>
                  <p>Others that uſe Cataplaſmes, or linnen dipt in warm Wine, I leave them to their old cuſtom, for many Surgeons that are experienced uſe them, and my Writings are not for them, but onely for Novices. If any ſuch Wounds comes to be cured by you, then ſtitch it cloſely that it have no vent, for the Wound will get vent before you ſhall be pleaſed with it. Be diligent and quick in healing, which if you do it not quickly, you will hardly do it afterward. And let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent have a vulnerary potion, over and above, for theſe are ſuch Wounds where the bones are hewed and cut thorough, and help Nature that way: Wounds that are before are more dangerous than thoſe behind. Uſe no tents nor ſearchings in the Wounds, for you will meet with difficulties enough, make you all the haſte with the healing; make uſe of the green Salve and Wound-plaiſter, theſe are ſufficient, bind and dreſs it well. I have never made uſe of warm Wine, nor of any Cataplaſm, becauſe I know it will keep not long warm, though it be applied ſo.</p>
                  <p>In caſe ſome miſchief ſhould happen by the falling in of ſomething into the Breaſt or Back-wound, and you are ſure that ſomething is fallen in, then look whether you can ſee it, and ſet the Patient into a very dark place, light a great can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, being of Wax, hold it directly at or over the Wound, then you may ſee better into the Wound then when the Sun ſhineth, feel not and ſearch not into the Wound; if you never felt into the Wound then you may, if it be fit, if not, then this is the beſt adviſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Make a Lavament of Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, let it run gently into the Wound through a Sirenge, that the in-fallen thing be not ſtirred, the patient muſt keep in his breath, and then let it go gently. Or take Water and Wine, <hi>ana,</hi> dry Roſe leaves, a few Cammomils and Mallows, boyl theſe together, pour it out, being ſettled, cant it off, uſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106818:58"/> the clear, make it luke-warm, waſh the Wound with it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, though ſome of it comes into the body it doth no hurt, and is conſumed, and cometh forth when you let the reſt run out of the Wound. Having uſed this Water to the Wound, then let the Patient ſuddenly cough, then the water will partly run out of the Wound, and bring forth that alſo which is fallen in, which you can take hold on, and draw it out fully: if that will not do it, then place the Patient with the Wound downward, that the water may run out, then look to it, whether there be not a partition at hand, before you ſet the Patient upright. This water you may uſe ſafely, for it will not hurt the body at all.</p>
                  <p>This is the onely remedy, which I know in this particular is uſed, which if it will not help, and the ravelings ſtay in the body, then nothing elſe is expected but a miſerable chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſeaſe, which will produce nothing but death, of the which I told you alſo formerly.

                  <p>VVOunds in the belly, if not quite through, are not dangerous: Here I comprehend all Wounds from the breaſt to the privy parts. Of ſlight Wounds in the belly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106818:59"/> I ſpeak little onely of the great Muſcles which are about the Navil; if theſe be hurt, then they muſt be well looked unto, becauſe they are dangerous; they eaſily putrifie, by reaſon of the abundant humor of the belly, anger and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoon getting into, and thereby great miſeries are cauſed, if not prevented: I intend not to ſpeak of all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but briefly of the chiefeſt.</p>
                  <p>The Belly being ſtabb'd or cut thorough, then the inward <note place="margin">Signs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts hurt.</note> parts are hurt thereby, which is known by ſome ſignes. For if the Patients food comes to the Wound, then is it a ſign, that the ſtomack is hurt; and if the excrements come into <note place="margin">Wounds of the ſtomack and guts.</note> the Wound, then is it a ſign, that the guts are wounded, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever inward part is hurt it is dangerous; for the Wounds of the Liver and Milt are perillous, as alſo the <note place="margin">Wounds of the Liver; Milt, Reins, Gall, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> Wounds in the Guts; the Wounds of the Gall, Reines and Bladder are counted mortal, and thoſe alſo of the Stomack. Surgeons muſt deal here, as they heard partly about the Breaſt-wounds: Wounds of the Lungs are held mortal, by reaſon of their conſtant motion, more than the Wounds of the Liver and Milt. Theſe Wounds muſt not be ſtitched, but ought to be healed with ſtiptick Plaiſters; neither muſt theſe Wounds be troubled with the Seeker or iron Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for if the Belly be run quite thorough, how can you ſound the Wound with the Inſtrument? And if any bloud vein was hurt, and ſtenched again, how ſoon may it be made bleed again with the Seeker, and make the thing worſe than it was? Heal the Wound outwardly, is inward cure chiefly depends from a good diet and phlebotomy; you may, if you pleaſe, make for ſuch a Patient a vulnerary Potion, made of Walwort, Stellaria, Starwort, and Liquorice.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Wounds of the Entrals, the old cuſtom may <note place="margin">Wounds of Guts.</note> here be followed, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtitch the wounded Entrals, and cleanſe them with Milk, in which Anniſe ſeed is boyled: However theſe Wounds are counted mortal, and it is a hard matter if ever they recover, becauſe inflammation ſoon gets in.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106818:60"/>
                  <p> This following is a rare Maſter-piece: If a Patient be wounded in the ſide or body, and you fear the Milt or Liver is hurt, whereby commonly great ſwelling is cauſed, then take this oyle, and annoint the Wound about, two hand-breadths, it will allay all hardneſs of the Wound, be it in the Belly, Liver, or Milt, and that in a ſhort time; it is the rareſt Remedy for ſuch Wounds, as experienced Surgeons know. For ſuch hardneſſes cauſe inflammations and feavers.</p>
                  <p>This Oyl is made thus: ℞ Of diſtilled oyl of Gum <note place="margin">Oil for a wounded Milt.</note> Ammoniack ℥ 2 of common Anniſe ſeed oyl ℥ 4. mingle theſe together; if the Wound is near the Liver, then uſe of Populeon ℥ 2. and leave out of the Anniſe ſeed oyl ℥ 2. enough of this at this time.</p>
                  <p>I will quote here a notable example, of one, whoſe urine run out at the Wound, and was recovered. <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. in <note place="margin">Urine run out of a Patients Wound.</note>

Firſt of all I ſtenched the bloud, then I applied to the Wound an Opodeldoch, and a Bean-plaiſter, in this manner I dreſſed him but once a day, to give no cauſe to the urine to paſs onely at the Wound. I uſed no tent, neither did I ſound the Wound with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for fear I ſhould touch any bloud vein, and ſo cauſe a freſh bleeding.

By theſe means I reduced the urine to its right place in three dayes, and the Patient recovered in a ſhort time. How could any one tell, what had been hurt here inwardly, but onely by the urines coming to that way? whither the fleſhy part of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders neck was hurt or no, troubled not me, nor ſtayed me in the healing of him, for my chiefeſt care was to reduce the urine to its natural courſe, and not to run through the Wound, and to cauſe a great deal of pains.</p>

I could divide theſe Wounds into ſeveral ſorts, as into Wounds of the legs, fleſh, ſinews and veins: it happeneth ſometimes, that all theſe four parts are hurt at once, and yet onely one of them wounded, this is the reaſon why I put them together into one.</p>
                  <p>Note, that you ought not to ſtitch any ſuch Wound, unleſs <note place="margin">Joynt-wounds not to be ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſs it have a flap.</note> there hang down a great flap of it, and chiefly have a care you ſtitch none of them that went into the great Muſcle or joynt, as in the Shoulder, Elbow, Hands, Knees, Knockles or Ankles, for if you ſtitch them with needle and threed (as the faſhion is) you will cauſe onely great pains, which would prove a fore-runner of many ſimptoms. Rather ſtitch them <note place="margin">To ſtitch with plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and bands.</note> with a twiſted ſtitch, or twiſted Silk, for theſe muſt be ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrongly, more ſtrongly than other Wounds, or elſe they break out again. For if you ſhould ſtitch a Wound on the Shoulder like one on the Belly, that ſtitch would not hold a day and a night. Therefore I adviſe you to uſe a very ſtrong one, eſpecially one upon the Wound as ſtrong as you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106818:61"/> can, yet ſtitch not too deep, for fear you hurt the ſinews or veins, for too much is nought; be moderate, proſpective and cautious in ſtitching, and not too haſty. Then apply the ſtitching plaiſter on the ſtitches, it will help to keep together: pull them even and well together with the plaiſter and roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, holding them together as long as you can, for it is good for the members and ſinews, and very good to further the healing. Though the Wound for all that doth keep aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, let it not trouble you, but go on, and preſs the Wound together, as it ought, at the ſeveral dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>If you have in hand a flap-wound, then do not cut off <note place="margin">Flap-wounds.</note> the flap, as many do, for Nature may ſtrangely recover that, and cloſe it in a ſhort time, therefore proceed thus: Stitch on the flap, but not over-ſtitch it, for fear you kill all the life in it, and after the ſtitching apply a Stitch-plaiſter to it, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it not with any feeling in, and ſounding, and trying whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtitch hold; and let the ſtitches not eat thorough, theſe elſe will cauſe ſcarrs; neither muſt you put any tent, be it flat or round, betwixt the flap and the body, nor ſuffer any water to come betwixt, but preſs the fleſh ſide of the flap cloſe to the body. Bind the Wound not too hard, but cloſe and gently, as the flap requireth, and cauſe as little pains to the Patient as you can; choak not the flap, elſe inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is cauſed, and make it thus, that the ſtitches do not hold all, but the band alſo muſt help, as you heard.</p>
                  <p>If you take off the Plaiſter, then pull it off not againſt <note place="margin">To take off the plaiſter.</note> the flap, which would cauſe great pains, but take it off with the flap, or by that ſide where it hung on a little, and by no meanes againſt the flap, and apply not any ſtrong clinging plaiſter, elſe at the taking it off you ſtir the flap and diſturbe the cure; the flap muſt be bound gently one manner of way, and not to day ſo, and to morrow another way, elſe the flap is hindered in its cloſing with the other fleſh.</p>
                  <p>If you have made two or three ſtitches, let the Silk not hang down into the Wound, elſe it cauſeth matter and ſlime in it, and hinders the flap in cloſing.</p>
                  <p>Have a care alſo you do it not too hard, nor pull againſt the flap, and apply alwayes a bolſter to the middle of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106818:61"/> flap, that it grow not hollow underneath; that you may do it the better, make vent with a tent, thruſting it under the flap, that the matter do not run upward but downward, and the tent muſt not be ſo long as to reach from one end to the other, elſe the flap will be raiſed and ſtirred.</p>
                  <p>Do not ſearch a Wound in a joynt with tents or the iron Inſtrument, for reaſons above quoted: do not put the Tent-ointment to a flat tent to apply it to the Wound, and then to lay a plaiſter upon; no, but let the Ointment run into the Wound to the bottom, and it muſt run every where in the Wound, and fill up the Wound with it, and the Brawn-oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt ſometimes be let run into it, it preventeth the running of the joynt water, cleanſeth the Wound, furthereth the healing, and ſuffereth no ſimptoms to be incident: if the flap be ſo great and broad, that of its own accord it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, <note place="margin">Flap ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth.</note> then make vent for it with a little tent, which muſt be very thin, that it ſtop not the matter, neither muſt it be too long, as to reach to both ends, which would increaſe the Wound, and looſen the flap.</p>
                  <p>Let the Wound have vent, that the Ointment may the better run to all the places of it, let the vent be in two or three places, it will cloſe at the vent holes as if it had been ſtitched, and skinneth freely; apply a ſtitch-plaiſter alſo for to keep the vent holes open: I have often uſed a Sirenge, ſpouting the Ointment into bloud-warm, and made the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge warm, that the Ointment ſhould not cool too faſt, and gently I ſpouted, elſe the wind of the Sirenge raiſeth the Wounds, veins and freſh fleſh, and cleanſed it as neatly as poſſibly could be, to which end my Siringe was ſo fitted, that it drew the Ointment eaſily, and let it run gently, as if it had but dropped into. And as there are two or three vent-holes to put the Medicine thereby into the Wound, ſo there muſt be vent-holes alſo at the neather part of the Wound, for the matter to run out there. For where the matter muſt be ſqueized out, there ſurely the healing is hindered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have alwayes put a tent into the Wound, to day on this ſide, and to morrow on that ſide, and never filled up or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Wound, ſo that the matter could come forth, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106818:62"/> needed not to be forced out; and when the moiſture or matter is come forth, then the Wound healeth the ſooner, and where the Ointment can run into all the places of the Wound, there the ſinew or joynt water is ſtaid, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from further pains freed.</p>
                  <p>Concerning other Manuals of ſuch Wounds, they have <note place="margin">Manuals in Joynt-wounds.</note> been ſpoken of before for the moſt part, however it will not be amiſs to rehearſe ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>It is requiſite, that Joynt-wounds be dreſſed once in eight hours, ſometimes in ſix hours, which I like better, for the joynt water is ſharp, and ſpoileth ſound things, the which you ought to oppoſe, and aid the Wound againſt the ſharpneſs of the joynt water, that things healed may not be made tender again by it: of this more ſhall be ſaid, when I treat of the joynt water.</p>
                  <p>And when you are to dreſs the Wound, then have all neceſſary things in readineſs, as I told you above, and let no air get into the Wound, and dreſs it ſpeedily, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay its healing; for if it be delayed, then lameneſs is cauſed, and the ſinews ſhrink and grow ſtiffe. Apply a ſtiptick plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Wound pretty well warmed, in the manner of an Opodeldoch, the plaiſter will work the better, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you apply alſo round about a defenſive plaiſter, to keep the Wound warm: of the which more ſhall be ſpoken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; the brown Ointment and other things ought not to be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Have a care in Joynt-wounds you do not ſtop too hard, for the joynt water cannot be ſtopped with any tents or ſtitches. Therefore let the Ointment run into the Wound, which ſtayeth the joynt water, that is, the humidity of joynts and ſinews, and every one hath a name for it: the <hi>Germans</hi> call it the Bands, for they bind and keep the Joynts together, &amp; for the moſt part there are the tendons which pull &amp; hold to it, which extend moſt behind the Joynt, and there are ſome which hold before alſo, theſe you muſt have a ſpecial care of; if a party be wounded either before or behind the Joynt, then ſtretch it out, perhaps the tendons is not hurt ſo much, it will be the better for the ſinews and veins, which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106818:62"/> there muſt be kept open and extended, and in the healing the ſinews alſo be help; it may be the hurt in the Joynt is ſuch, which may help it ſelf: if the Wound be either below or behind the Joynt, then lay it bent or bow'd, that the ſinews may not ſhrink and be helped partly, and heal up that Wound in ſixteen dayes, and neglect nothing, let the Wound not grow too full with fleſh; for I have ſeen, that ſuch fleſh hath cauſed a ſhortneſs, and lamed the party: Such neglects happen in Burnt wounds, as I have ſeen it, and more ſhall be ſpoken of, when I treat of Burnt-wounds and Aduſtions.</p>
                  <p>And you look to, that the like do not befal you, which would prejudice both the Patient and you; and look well to his lying, and extend the wounded joynt every day but a little, and do not heal the Patient lame, if he be not lame wounded. Let himſelf ſtir it too and fro by little and little; my ſelf have mollified ſuch lamed members, that were lame healed, and brought them to right. And when you ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e all difficulties paſt, which were preſent at the firſt, then begin more and more to bend and bow the joynt, but ſo, that you cauſe no pains in the joynt, and in caſe he feeleth any, then annoint him with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Dialthoeae,</hi> let the wounded joynt hang, and not to be carried in a band, neither muſt he lift his foot up, nor ſet it down, as he uſed formerly, as long as you fear the joynt water, heat, ſwelling or pain in the joynt, then let him lift the joynt upward, according as the place is: This he muſt not do too long; but when he can endure it, then let him hang the joynt downward, that the bloud and heat may come to the place again, otherwiſe Exiccations and Conſumptions are cauſed, and the ſinews drie up, if the joynt be kept too long bound upward, and in caſe at the hanging down of his leg or hand a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling appeareth, let it not trouble you, for that will paſs away and ſink; but if that a ſwelling is in it, then is it a ſign, that ſome untoward thing ſtaid in the Wound, for in the Joynt muſt not remain any ſpiſſitude or groſsneſs when it is almoſt healed, much leſs muſt any ſuch fatneſs be healed up. My way was this, when a party was wounded, then I applied
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106818:63"/> round about the Wound a plaiſter, which I leſt there four or five dayes or more, and that was a hand breadth round the Wound; and if the parties either Knee or Elbow was wounded, I tied clothes about his Foot or hand, to keep off ſwellings (for theſe ſwellings are nothing elſe but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, unleſs it be an Impoſthume or Dropſie, which are not humours but ſimptoms) and that no humours might come to the Wounds, nor to the uttermoſt parts of the wounded member, as the Hand or Foot. For I have ſeen humours fall into the Hand or Foot, which could never be gotten from thence; which miſchief to prevent, I applied alſo a Plaiſter to the whole member, Arm, Hand, Finger, Toes. For a humour fallen into the uttermoſt part is hardly gotten out again after the Wound be healed, more hardly than it is gotten from within the Wound.</p>
                  <p>And that was my ſtitching-plaiſter which I applied thus, and it is better to take it off dry, then when it keeps moiſt, becauſe it openeth the pores, if applied to the hand or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and performeth its vertue as it ought to do; I applied my ſtitch-plaiſter for the moſt part to the whole part of the member, in places where I feared conſumption, tenderneſs, exiccation, and in ſuch members wherein a ſwelling was, to diſperſe the moiſture, and where I could not well make uſe of my Salve againſt ſhrinkings. The member keeps very warm under that plaiſter, and counted it Gods bleſſing. For I ſhew you hereafter how I uſed it, and did much good with it. For it was my Fracture-plaiſter to all beaten, broken and ſwelled members.</p>
                  <p>When I name, my Plaiſter, then you muſt underſtand this Plaiſter, or mine unknown Plaiſter, that you may know alſo, what Plaiſter it was I uſed to ſuch Wounds and hurts. The ſwelling and pain being gone, and the member able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the annointing, then with all ſpeed annoint it with Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaea, I alwayes carefully uſed my Ointment againſt ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l ſhew when I ſpeak of ſhrinking. For though no ſhrinking appeared, yet I ſtill feared, and prevented it with the Ointment before any exiccation came, and whilſt the member was yet ſwelled. I did uſe no cooling Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106818:63"/> but warming ones. I had made a Populeon, which I kept twenty five years, not that I contemned the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I never uſed it; I alwayes uſed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoea</hi> to wounded Members: underſtand me well, I do not write now of impoſthumes, ſores and other inflamed hurts, but of all manner of heats in Wounds; for I alwayes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that ſuch heats do not come from the heat of the Member, but from an accident, which ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, then the heat goeth ſoon out of the Member wounded.</p>
                  <p>For I have often ſeen, that when they thought to reſiſt the heat outward, as with Goats milk, in which is boyled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Leth argyre, Salt and Water, ſome took alſo Sallade oyl and Lie, ſome took Nightſhade and Houſleek, and others what they pleaſed: I am not againſt it, but I never uſed it; for I ſuppoſed ſtill, things outward may not hurt the Wounds: your care muſt be onely, firſt to bring the Wound to right, then other means may be uſed for the reſt: and I thought ſtill alſo, it may be the Member hath bled too much, and wanteth warmth, and if there be any heat, it comes from the pain of ſinews and other accidents. For that reaſon I uſed no warming things, for I thought, if I uſe warm things then the bloud is gone, and warming things will bring other bloud into, which cauſeth runnings, and uſually Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humes, which I know experimently, and theſe Impoſthuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have done much hurt to the Members, and cauſed great pains, which terrified me ſo much, that I would never uſe any warming things, as uſually Cataplaſmes are uſed, of Lin ſeed, Fenugreek, Walwort, &amp;c. and applied warm, and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Bolſters in warm Wine, and Balſam oyl poured into the Wound. I muſt confeſs I uſed ſuch things alſo three years together, but I gave them over, and took my other things in hand, and uſed neither hot nor cold, onely made uſe of Dialthaea, and uſed it onely luke-warm.</p>
                  <p>There were many times found about the Wound Bliſters <note place="margin">Bliſters &amp; Wharts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Wounds.</note> and Wharts, which were cauſed by the hot dreſſings, and ſometimes the ſalt Flegm of the Patient hath been the cauſe of it: in ſuch a caſe I took onely my <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum,</hi> which I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106818:64"/> will deſcribe, moiſtning it with a little Vinegar, which ſoon healed it.</p>
                  <p>And when any proud fleſh appeared, and one place grew <note place="margin">Proud fleſh</note> ſooner and higher, then I uſed burnt Allom, let it be there, till it fell off of its own accord, and if need, I uſed it once more, if not, I let it alone.</p>
                  <p>To comprehend all in one, about Joynt-wounds, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things: <hi>Viz.</hi> Fill the Joynt-wound with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> dreſs and bind it well, let no air come into, bind it nimbly, neither too hot, nor too cold, nor too hard, keep it quiet, ſeek and ſearch not in it, keep it pretty well open, thruſt nothing between, onely one vent above for a paſſage of the Ointment, and another below, let not the Patient drink much Wine, prepare and make all things ready before you undreſs it, and let not the Member hang down. Neither take out any ſhattered piece, unleſs it be quite looſe; and in caſe a bone be cut thorough in a Joynt-wound, and yet it ſticketh to the ſinew, it muſt not be cut or digged out, as ſome uſe to do, but rather ſet it into its right place, let the work be done by the Lords bleſſing and the Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Therefore pull out nothing, unleſs there be great cauſe for it, for theſe will not be obſtructive unto the healing, nor cauſe pains: conſider the things well at firſt, feel not in the Wound like a blind man, eſpecially if you go about to cut or looſen any thing in the Wound, and ſtay for the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome dayes, as long as nothing is yet neglected, and though healing goeth on the more ſlowly, yet is it the more convenient and ſafer.</p>
                  <p>I was called once to a Patient, whoſe knee-pan was cloven, <note place="margin">Example.</note> whom another Surgeon undertook to cure, and would needs ſhew his skill on him, he looſened the knee-pan, thinking he had done well. But what happened after the pan was taken out? The pan feel aſunder, and looked moſt ugly, for he could look into it afore well enough, and gaped ſo farre aſunder, that two fingers could be put in, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either ſide. This Knee put me and that Shaver to great troubles before we could fill up the place with fleſh, for the Joynt-water guſhed in ſo faſt, that all Medicines were thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106818:64"/> out thereby; at laſt it was ſtayed by the brown Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a good Opodeldoch, the place was filled out with fleſh, and the Patient by Gods help cured. But he was halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that leg; and I am confident, if the knee-pan had not been taken out, he would have been more perfectly cured without any defect.</p>
                  <p>I will quote another example: In my travels, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook <note place="margin">Another Example.</note> for to get knowledge, I came to a Surgeon, who was famous and expert man, who undertook to cure one, in whoſe Hand a bone was diſlocated, and ſeemed to be quite looſe, and the Surgeon, held it to be ſo, and went to take it out, but it ſtuck ſo faſt yet to the ſinew, that it came not ſo eaſily off as he firſt ſuppoſed, and ſo he thought to looſen it quite; but the Surgeon loſt almoſt all his credit by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could do ſo little good upon him: For when he cut off the ſinew, he cauſed ſuch lamentable pains to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that he was not able to have it handled any more, and ſo the Surgeon was fain to let the bone alone, and dreſſed the Wound, and cured it; but that bone was not healed to the firſt place of it, for after healing it was moveable, however it was no hinderance to his hand. That Surgeon afterward told often, that he could not have gotten out that bone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cutting of the ſinew, which would have cauſed a lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Hand, which in this way was avoided. By theſe examples you may ſee, how perillous it is to take any ſmall bones out of a Wound that are not quite looſe.</p>
                  <p>Note by theſe Joynt-wounds; a Joynt being in the ſaid manner wounded, then the Joynts ſtand looſe and weak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, eſpecially if the Wounds be deep; then ſuch Wounds muſt be helped with underproppings and bolſters, and the place be eaſed of the weight, chiefly if on the Hand or Arm. But how that dreſſing is done, ſhall be ſhewed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bone-fractures.</p>
                  <p>Note further, if a Joynt-wound ſtinketh after eight or <note place="margin">Signs of a Wound that fals to a ſtinking.</note> nine dayes, then have a care that no inflammation come into: For if any blackneſs comes to the Wound, and the Wound is ſoft, then is it a good ſign, for then the inflammation is going away, and the Wound inclineth unto healing But
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106818:65"/> if that blackneſs in the Wound clingeth hard, and will not ſeparate and part from the redneſs, then is it a certain ſign, that an inflammation is at hand, which muſt be oppoſed in that manner, as you ſhall hear of in its due place. And in caſe the Patient complaineth alſo in the uttermoſt part of that Member, then no other remedy is left, but that Member muſt be cut off, or elſe the party muſt die. But in caſe it do ſeparate, and will not ſtick to the ſtinking veins and ſinews, then pull it forth, as much as the Patient is able to endure it, and cut off as much as you can come by, for the Wound doth hardly cleanſe, when the Sinews will not ſeparate but ſtay in it, which muſt come out, if ſo be the Wound ſhall be healed. But that which is good yet muſt by no meanes be pulled out and cut off; for the leſs you take away from the black gray veins, the better it is, for if you take out much it cauſeth larne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For theſe hamſtrings tendons keep the Joynts to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and give them their power. For when theſe are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then all hopes are gone, and the Patient cannot be brought to right, and is like a chain of Beads without a ſtring. To that end good heed muſt be taken, that a Wound breath ſtrongly, by reaſon of the veins and ſinews, which are ſtill cleanſing themſelves.</p>
                  <p>For no Wound can be dreſt ſo ſoon, but the fleſh and veins will change and ſeparate; however I did read, and heard it alſo, that ſome Wounds were healed, which never had any matter in them: I confeſs I never ſaw it, and will not gain-ſay it, but leave them to their opinion. For I am but a common Barber-Surgeon, not learned and much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, neither am I he that hath ſeen all things; yet I have cured a ſtab without bearing any matter, and that ſtab was but narrow. I have cut Hare-lips and Canker-wounds, which bred very little of corruption, and ſeparated in the leaſt degree, and made a ſhew of purging, like other Wounds, but not ſo much; this happened by reaſon of the fleſh kept warm together in the ſtitching, and received not yet any alteration or air. For in caſe a Wound, Stab, or other hurt receiveth air, then they alwayes bear and breed matter, and when it thruſteth off and ſeparateth unto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106818:65"/> then muſt it firſt putriſie, (for fleſh that is freſh doth not putrifie) then a ſtink is cauſed, which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied with the brown Ointment, then that ſtink will ceaſe in two or three dayes, and you need not to fear the Prunella or inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Note further, in caſe the Marrow be wounded, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">When the Marrow is hurt.</note> a Conſumption or Exiccation is cauſed after the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which commonly is incident to all Joynt-wounds. This I mention to this end, that you ſhould prevent theſe ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and not tarry their coming: but how you ought to handle ſuch things, ſhall be ſhewed in the Chapter of ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſumptions.</p>
                  <p>What hitherto hath been ſpoken of Wounds in Joynts <note place="margin">Wounded Muſcles.</note> and Members, the ſame muſt be meant alſo of Wounds and Stabs made upon the great Muſcles, for all manner of ſuch ſimptoms are incident, <hi>viz.</hi> Prunella or Inflammation, as you heard of by the Joynt-members, which Wounds you muſt not ſtitch neither with the needle, but onely let the Ointment run into, and apply the Wound-plaiſter to it, as I told you before.</p>
                  <p>Touching other common Wounds, where the fleſh onely is wounded, and none of the ſinews, muſcles and bones, any Surgeon may eaſily heal them, if he hath but ordinary skill, And I hold it needleſs to write much of them, not intending to ſhew the curing of ſlight Wounds.</p>
                  <p>But if an Arm or Bone be thus, that all the bones thereof are ſhattered, and the Member hangeth onely by the fleſh, <note place="margin">When bones veins and ſinews are aſunder.</note> then their condition is this. In caſe that part which hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down is ſenſeleſs, cauſed either by too much bleeding or too much cold, then the ſafeſt way is to cut it off. But in caſe there is ſome life in it yet, then ſet the down hanging part to its right place, and dreſs that Wound like as the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a leg is dreſſed, which is gone through the fleſh. But mighty great care is to be had, to keep the Patient as quiet as may be, and to dreſs the Wound ſeveral times with the brown Ointment.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell you alſo, how you muſt deal with wounded fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: <note place="margin">Of wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fingers.</note> Though Fingers are but ſmall parts, yet they muſt be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106818:66"/> cared for whilſt they are whole, and theſe being wounded require as great cares in the dreſſing as bigger Members do, and that by reaſon of the many ſimptoms which eaſily befal them.</p>
                  <p>Note, a wounded Finger muſt not be bound hard, which <note place="margin">To dreſs Fingers.</note> ſoon are killed through hard binding, bind them ſomewhat ſlack, and begin at the nail firſt toward the Hand; for if you begin behind toward the Fingers end, then you drive the bloud forward, which killeth the Finger, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation is cauſed. This manner of dreſſing belongs alſo to the reſt Members, except the Legs, which require another manner of binding.</p>
                  <p>You ought not to ſtitch any wounded Finger, though it <note place="margin">Fingers ought not to be ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> hangeth but by a little, but underlay it with ſplinters or little boards to make it lie even and quiet, which is done eaſily. In this manner the Finger healeth the ſooner, and is not ſubject to ſo many ſimptoms, as when they were ſtitched.</p>
                  <p>Neither ought ye to uſe any Tents to wounded Fingers, <note place="margin">To uſe no Tents to Finger and Hand-wounds.</note> nor to any wounded Hand, becauſe of the many white veins that lie in the Hand, and meet there, and uſually lameneſſes are cauſed if Tents uſed, which are prevented if Tents omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But this rule is little regarded by theſe, which think themſelves wiſe men, and hear the graſs grow (as they ſay.)</p>
                  <p>Neither muſt you let the wounded Fingers ſuffer cold, but keep them in a convenient warmth. There is no Member which can leſs endure cold than the Finger, and no where more hurt and lameneſs expected, and the running of the joynt water, than there. And the cold fire is eaſily inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent here, which is obſtructive unto health. Dreſs it not hard nor ſtrongly, becauſe the hard binding cauſeth inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: for if the bloud dieth, then that Member muſt die alſo, eſpecially if the Hand or Finger be angry, or when too many cold things are uſed. For many times there is a grim anger in the Hand or Finger, by reaſon of the veins and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, which is cauſed ſometimes by a cold humour fallen into, and riſeth as if there were great heat in it, and that heat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent there, comes from the pain, and not from the heat, as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106818:66"/> I ſhall diſtinguiſh between them, when I come to ſpeak of the hot and cold fire.</p>
                  <p>If a finger grow lame, then is it better and fitter to heal it <note place="margin">To heale lame Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> crooked than ſtraight, the reaſon is known. In other things dreſs a wounded Finger as other Joynt-wounds are dreſt, bow it not much, nor let it be much ſtirred till it be almoſt healed: and for the keeping off of the joyn water, uſe often the brown Ointment, let it run into the Wound: it is good to uſe here a defenſive Plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>Bathings are good for wounded Fingers alſo, made of Lie of Pine wood aſhes and ſome Walwort boyled in it.</p>
                  <p>Let no Finger fall into the Hand, be it which it will, but rather keep it out, for though a benummed Finger be a mighty hinderance, yet a Finger healed crookedly into the Hand is moſt hurtful, it were better to be without that Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as to have it healed crooked into the Hand. And if a Finger be ſtraight healed, it hindereth the Patient alſo in his work; a middle way muſt be uſed here, that the wounded Finger be healed neither too ſtraight nor too crooked, in caſe its benumming cannot be avoided. As it happeneth many times, that a Member will be lame do what ye can, then in time the fitteſt courſe muſt be taken for it, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it, whereby great pains to the Patient may be cauſed. Briefly, a wounded Finger muſt not be dreſt extended and out-ſtretched, nor let fall ſo much into the Hand; and if more than one Finger is wounded, whilſt you are healing one, do not ſtir the other much, unleſs you know them faſt enough, for theſe cannot brook ſo much of Medicines as other great Members; and make uſe of the brown Ointment to the wounded Finger, it cleanſeth very much.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth ſometimes alſo, that at the end of the Finger there groweth a great Callus: have a care that not too much fleſh grow there, it will ſhew ugly. And be careful in the dreſſing, for if you bind it too ſlack, then fleſh groweth high there, therefore bind it well together with the roulers, but take heed aſo that you do not bind it too hard, as to pain and to make his Finger ſwell, and the bloud be choaked and quite killed, as I have ſeen ſometimes fall out ſo, and make no
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106818:67"/> knots when you tie the Finger, for they cut in deep, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſe of the bloud, and pinch more ſtrongly, than it may be beleived. I ſtitched the band with a needle and threed, and uſed the bands in the beſt manner, and tied it cloſe enough to prevent the growing of any Callus in the Wound, and the Finger grow to an ill ſhape: the like muſt be prevented in other Members, where ſome excreſcencies may fall, when you ſuffer the fleſh to grow too much. For a Joynt-wound cannot be healed, but ſome fleſh muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow; and a Joynt hath but little fleſh, and when there more fleſh groweth than there was before, than it ſtands out, eſpecially on the foremoſt parts of the Finger, there uſually ſuch knots are, and there the little bones alſo go out, becauſe they have leſs help of the ſinews than other Members.</p>
                  <p>And if any be wounded through the nail, this alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an unſhaped Finger, therefore on that place ſuffer but little fleſh to grow, as little as may be, for then the nail will ſtand out high, and the Finger will ſhew ugly, do not ſtitch and Joynt of a Finger, it would cauſe pains and a lameneſs, beſides the excreſcence. It is beſt and ſafeſt that a wounded finger be not ſtitched, unleſs need require it, if ſo, then do but one ſtitch to it, if the condition of the Wound requireth no other.</p>
                  <p>If any be wounded behind the Thumb, ſo that the great <note place="margin">The Thumb ſinews in pieces.</note> ſinew be in two, for there goeth a ſtrong ſinew down from the Shoulder, divideth it ſelf about the Elbow, from thence it ſcattereth into the Hand, and through them is maintained the whole Hand with the Fingers, in their motion. This wounded and thorough cut ſinew you muſt fetch about and bring to light with an Inſtrument (if you can) and ſtitch it ſtrongly together, but the Wound muſt not be ſtitched, and ſo this ſinew will heal together again, and preſerve the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from lameneſs.</p>
                  <p>If one be wounded in his Arm, before or behind the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, then look well to the great ſinew; and if one be cut <note place="margin">Arm-wound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Elbow.</note> ſo, that he lets ſink his Hand, then is the Thumb ſinew cut, which you may ſtitch ſhort, that his hand may not continue
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106818:67"/> thus hanging, but be healed as quickly as poſſible it may be, therefore bind the Hand upward, let it not hang ſo.</p>
                  <p>For I have ſeen a Barber, that was cut in that manner and <note place="margin">Example.</note> healed, but his Hand continued hanging, which another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Surgeon undid, and cut a Wound near the place, and preſſed the great ſinew together, even as an Eagles claw which Children carry about, and draw it to and fro.</p>
                  <p>Another alſo was cut lame, and cured lame, but another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did it again, and healed him ſtraight.</p>
                  <p>Another was cured lame of a Wound cut in his Knee, that Wound was opened again, and cured better afterward.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe Cures I have ſeen, but the reſt were by men of credit done, and I underſtand the cauſe may be thus, If any ones skin, fleſh, veins, ſinews and all be wounded, and ſtitched together, they let him lie ſtill in a poſture, and ſo heal him lame, though he received not a Wound unto lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I found ſo, and ſpeak it by experience, that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in that kind may be neglected, that is thus cured; therefore ſuffer not alwayes a Patient to be cured, who lieth ſtill, and never ſtirreth, never ſtretcheth his Leg, nor boweth it, or the like; for healing ſtiffeneth the nerves, arteries, fleſh, pannicle, and ſtiffeneth them together, and thoſe being thus ſtiffened and grown together, then the one ſuffereth not the other to perform its work perfectly, in the pulling up, and the ſtretching out, as they ought to do of their own accord. Therefore I give you fair warning, not to cure any in ſuch a quiet poſture, but ſtir him ſtill, then you ſhall ſee, and the Patient will feel, that the Member of the body begins to be uſed too, and ſtirs of it ſelf, and ſo that which is not quite lame may be preſerved, and that which is unfound they muſt leave as it is; you muſt not do too many ſtitches in the great ſinews, for you ſtitch it through, which was not cut through, and make more holes into than you need, and you will cauſe a lameneſs, which would not have been, if it had not been for your ſtitching; for theſe ſtitches are not made for plainneſs ſake, but to help and keep that together which was not hurt, and to keep the further part from hanging.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:106818:68"/>
                  <p> And this happeneth to no Member ſo ſoon as to the <note place="margin">The thumbs uſe.</note> Thumb, and ſo no Member ought to be puld and bound more upwards than the Thumb; for if the Thumb fals or ſinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Parties Hand, it is not onely for no uſe, but is hurtful alſo; for what keeps ſtronger hold in the whole Hand but the Thumb? for when the other Fingers pull to, then the Thumb meets them. But if the Thumb lieth in the hand, then he not onely holdeth nothing, but lets go that alſo which is given and put into.</p>
                  <p>Therefore be careful, be the Wound cut, ſhot, or lamed any way, to ſet the Thumb out of the Hand, for it will fall ſoon enough into the Hand, more than it will be to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients liking, regard not the Patients complaint, if he ſaith, that he cannot bring his Thumb into the Hand, for in caſe he muſt be lame, yet the Thumb ſtanding out of the Hand, is of better uſe, then if within.</p>
                  <p>Have alwayes a care to the Thumb, for the Thumb ſtands in better ſtead in the Hand than two other Fingers, and do not let it fall into the Hand, for after the healing it will fall into the Hand however. Briefly, keep the Thumb upwards in all your dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>This happeneth not onely to this great ſinew, but alſo to other ſinews and veins, if you can come by them to ſtitch them, as here by this great ſinew, doubtleſs they will grow together and heal. But the Surgeon muſt ſtill be provided with good Medicaments to prevent ſimptoms.</p>
                  <p>If any ones hand be wounded, theſe Wounds ought not to be ſtitched nor tented, leſs than any other Wound, by reaſon <note place="margin">No Wound to be ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Hand.</note> of the many bones and ſinews. This rule is ſlighted by a great many, and this is the reaſon, that when a party hath received a wound on the Hand, though the Wound was but ſlight, the fingers are not onely ſtiffe and defective, but ſometimes the whole Hand groweth lame thereby, which ſuch ſuppoſed Surgeons have cauſed with their ſtitches and Tents, truly the Magiſtrate ſhould puniſh ſuch fellows ſeverely, which do ſpoil the people in this manner. <note place="margin">Whether a cold or a hot dreſſing be better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I come to ſpeak of cold and hot dreſſings, of which ſomething hath been ſpoken already in the firſt part: here
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106818:68"/> are many abuſes and faults committed, Touching this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, whether a Wound ought to be dreſſed cold or hot, in my mind, according to my experience, it is beſt to dreſs it milk-warm. Therefore care muſt be had, that the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Oyls and ſuch like be uſed warm, which pleaſeth and fitteth Wounds beſt, and to keep in theſe with bolſters and roulers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The general fault herein is, that many apply their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as hot as ever they can, thinking they do very well, <note place="margin">Hot dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is hurt full.</note> eſpecially when they apply their Cataplaſmes, made of marſh Mallows, Lin ſeed, Butter, Oyl, Milk, Meal, Roſe cakes; with ſuch things they think to do great wonders. Such Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes may do good, when ſwellings are to be ripened and ſoftned.</p>
                  <p>But to apply them to Wounds, will cauſe but miſchiefs, <note place="margin">Cauſe of putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> becauſe ſuch hot things applied cauſe putrefaction, which in Wounds ought not to be. For ſuch Poulteſſes choak up Wounds, which of neceſſity breeds corruption: and when theſe are taken off from the Wound, there comes a great fume from the Wound, very moiſt and wet, which is a ſure fore-runner and ſign of putrefaction, cauſed by that ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which paineth the Wound exceedingly, and bringeth <note place="margin">Sign of it.</note> great hurt unto it. And if it be a Joynt-wound, there ſettleth uſually a moiſture about the Joynt, where like a Tartar it doth coagulate, thence is cauſed a lameneſs, becauſe that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter groweth harder and harder, and taketh root there; and all this is meerly cauſed by choaking the Wound with ſuch hot Cataplaſmes.</p>
                  <p>Experience ſheweth ſufficiently, that when theſe pap-Cooks <note place="margin">A ſtinking Bird ſtayes in the Neſt.</note> with their Poulteſſes have healed a Wound, where many veins and ſinews lie, commonly a ſtinking Bird ſtayeth behind in the Neſt (as I told you in the firſt part.) For how often doth it fall out, that a wounded man being healed, afterward is mightily pained and ſwelled, which ſuch Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Pains and ſwellings in Wounds.</note> are not able to help; for if ſuch errors are not known of them whilſt the Wound is open, what wonders ſhould theſe Surgeons perform after the Wound is cloſed?</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106818:69"/>
                  <p> Touching cold dreſſings, they are not good but hurtful, <note place="margin">Cold dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hurtful</note> and are to be avoided, becauſe they cauſe cramps, great pains in veins and ſinews: therefore at the dreſſing of Wounds a right warmth is uſed, conformable unto Nature, neither too hot nor too cold.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, ſome Wounds are hot, and ſome are cold, and, ſo they muſt be dealt withal accordingly, as neceſſity requireth.</p>
                  <p>I reply, that that heat or cold is not to be regarded, for if good and proper Medicaments are uſed, they cool the hot, and warm the cold parts by their own vertue and quality, Therefore if a Wound be hot, do not think to drive away that heat by a cold dreſſing; and ſo it is with a cold Wound, for proper Medicines muſt do the fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. For as a <note place="margin">Good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines do cool and warm.</note> cold thing quencheth not a fire, but water and other liquid things doth it, be the water hot or cold, it is all one, its moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will quench it; even ſo are good Medicines effected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wounds.</p>
                  <p>Therefore do not ſay, this is cold and this is hot in the Wound, but ſay, it is a ſimptom: Now as there is a variety of ſimptoms, ſo they require ſeveral Medicaments; and hot ones alſo, as oyl of Turpentine, Petroleum; there are ſome hot Wounds alſo which ask for coolers, according as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, which muſt be obſerved carefully. And if there be any pains in the Wound, then things are not right, either the Patient hath done amiſs, or the Medicine was not proper, or a ſimptom is coming on, then the Medicine muſt be altered accordingly, but no hot nor cold dreſſing is to be uſed.</p>

                        <hi>Of cloven Nails on Fingers, and of their cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SOmetimes the Nails on Fingers are cloven either the long or the croſs way, and are almoſt wholly looſe. And when they hang yet a little faſt at the uttermoſt part, you may cut it off, but it will be long before another cometh, for the fleſh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106818:69"/> about the Nail commonly groweth high, and hindereth the Nails growth; if that hanging Nail be tied it is painful, yet it may not ſo neatly be healed as a new one would ſhew. According as the party is, whether a Tradeſman, or one that is often abroad at feaſts, ſuch ought to be cured neatly, and ſuch a cure may be performed within ten dayes: if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty looketh often on his Finger, he miſliketh the double Nail, and it looketh double when ſplitted, unleſs it be well tied together: if a Nail be ſplitted the croſs way, then at the Fingers end there will be a Callus. It is better if a Nail be ſplitted the long way. Be it which way it will, if it holds faſt, do not cut it, becauſe without cauſing pains it cannot be cut; let it not gape farre aſunder; uſe conſtantly burnt Allom pulveriſed; Nails uſually raiſe and thruſt the fleſh upwards, and are of tedious healing. A Nail that begins to cloſe again muſt be kept bound continually, as hard as the Patient is able to endure it, and ſtill pare the old Nail away; take heed you make it not bleed at the paring; the old Nail will give way to the young one, even as an old Tooth giveth way to a young one. This is the faireſt cure, if you can bring it ſo to paſs, and cauſeth the leaſt pains, and ſuffereth not the fleſh to grow high. Learn to know well the new Nail, for at firſt it appeareth like a blew skin; do not try whether it be a Nail or no, for if you touch it with any Iron, Finger, or Nail, it gets a ſcarr, and will not be toucht, neither will it look ſo fair, as when you lay a plaiſter to it, and tie it cloſe together with linnen, then the Nail will be ſtiffe, cloſe, ſmooth and even; but if you touch it, it groweth rugged, which hardly can be rectified afterward; therefore help, that the old Nail touch not the new one, it doth hinder elſe: the old Nail ſtill giveth way from above, and groweth looſe, cut it off, but do not pull it off; for of its own accord it goeth off more and more, keeps down the fleſh, that the young Nail may grow over it, If you ſhould pull off the Nail, it would pain the party, and the fleſh would grow high, and hinder the young Nails growing. Therefore take heed you do not cut the old Nail too faſt, neither leave too much of the old Nail, it would prove a hinderance to the young
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106818:70"/> Nails growing; neither muſt the old Nail be cut too cloſe, neither leave too much of it, ſo the new Nails coming will not be hindered; the Finger at the end muſt be tied moſt ſtrongly, and make the Finger ſharp and pointed, becauſe it will fall broad enough at laſt</p>
                  <p>Many times the Nail groweth rugged and unſhaped, therefore lay a ſtiffe plaiſter to it, and a little well-wrought green Wax, it will keep the Nail from ruggedneſs: in caſe the Nail doth feſter, then uſe my red unknown plaiſter, which I ſhall ſhew hereafter, let it lie there ſix dayes; it keeps the Nail from ruggedneſs, and maketh it even and ſmooth: tie it ſtiffely, elſe the Nail ſtands high out.</p>
                  <p>But care muſt be had alſo, that the Fingers end be not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with too hard binding; tie it with a fine ſmall tape, make no knots, but pin it; in caſe the Nail be contuſed, then it looks blew, black, yellow, red and quite mortified, as when a Stone, Hammer, Wine-pipe, or any other heavy thing is fallen upon; then make a hole with a Raiſor on the Nail, ſome do it with a piece of glaſs, and get out the bloud under it, make that hole not too little, but as wide as it may be, and lame it not at the cutting, apply to it the brown Ointment, it keepeth the Nail from feſtering, rotting and ſtinking: do not cut away all the Nail, it will looſen it ſelf without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: that Finger muſt not be tied hard; but ſlack; and in caſe the Nail be ſo much looſe that it will not ſtick or hang on, then cut it away. But take heed here, and be warned, if there be no neceſſity for the cutting off of it, then let it alone, as you were told alſo before about the cutting off of members: for I have ſeen, many times, ſuch Fingers healed to the admiration.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth ſometimes alſo, that a Finger is lamed with glaſs, iron, ſtick, or other wood ſplinters, ſomewhat of it remaining in the Finger: here you muſt have a care how to get it out again; ſometimes ſuch a piece of glaſs, wood, &amp;c. gets into the Joynt, which is a ſlippery part, and is ſhut up there, and cannot be gotten out at the firſt Wound where it entred, then Inſtruments and other means muſt be uſed to get it out, and take heed you do not break it: When you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106818:70"/> have gotten it out, then uſe the ſtiptick plaiſter, and if you doubt that ſomewhat remained behind, then uſe that plaiſter and apply it right to the place: do not feel and groap much in the Finger, leaſt you make it angry; for feeling with the Iron into the Wound, and touching a ſmall bone, then a mark you put on there which will not heal ſo eaſily: If it raiſeth and is ſoft, then do not lance it preſently, let it grow very ripe, then the iron, glaſs, wood, &amp;c. that is in it will looſen, and the fleſh fals off from it, and comes forth eaſily: For if you ſhould open it preſently, before the ſplinter be looſe, then you would hinder its putrefaction and ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it will ſoon ſeparate, and be looſe at the feſtering, be it glaſs, or what it is, &amp;c. from the ſinews, ligaments, or fleſh, for all what ſticketh to it, at the feſtering it muſt part from it. Being parted, it healeth then eaſily, no Tent you ought to uſe, for it looſneth of its own accord. If you ſhould take it out forcibly, then that part would be lamed. I do not ſay, that at the firſt you ſhould let it feſter, as ſoon as it comes to your hand: no, but when you think that ſome piece ſtaid behind, then no need to ſeek in it, but apply onely the ſtiptick plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; if there be nothing in it, then is it needleſs, but if there be any thing in it, it muſt be had out, though it ſhould be made looſe with a ſharp or ſmall Tent, which is better than lancing: I confeſs, I made uſe ſometimes of cutting out ſuch ſplinters, but never ſearched in the hole with the Inſtrument. Therefore lay hold on the appearance of a ſplinter, nail, thorn, &amp;c. that entered into a Joynt, be it the Ankle, Knee, Elbow, Hand, &amp;c. for a ſplinter ſtayeth not in that place where it entered, unleſs the Patient never ſtirre, but as ſoon as he ſtirs then the ſplinter goeth further and ſlideth off. I have ſeen ſtrange paſſages with ſuch ſplinters, <hi>viz.</hi> they came forth a ſpan from the hole they entered at, thus ſlippery are the Joynts if ſtirred.</p>
                  <p>I could write marvellous things that happened to me, <hi>viz.</hi> one ſplinter parted into three pieces, none of theſe came out with the other, and ſome weeks paſt between, before they came forth the one after the other: many ſuch Patients I had.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106818:71"/>
                  <p> Therefore be not deceived, neither marvel at, that when a ſplinter, nail, thorn, is gone into a Joynt, you find it no more in that place. Stirring is good for ſuch a party, that the ſplinter may appear and break out in another place, and that at an oppoſite place, either above or below it. In caſe a ſplinter ſtayeth long in the Joynt, it will make long work for the Surgeon, therefore ſuch Joynts muſt be looked to ſpeedily, and the thing that entered into be gotten out, for the bones in the Joynt are not ſo ſtrong as they are in the Arm or Leg, but are covered with Arteries, which are weaker than bones: The further the bone is from the Joynt, the harder it is to be cut or broken; and hurts about the Joynt are more dangerous than thoſe which are further off. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Joynt hath its own ligaments, which hold the Joynt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and if any thing ſtayeth in theſe ligaments, it putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth them, and that Joynt will not be ſo flexible as it was before, and ſometimes a ſmall putrefaction lameth it quite. And if you do not know what to do in ſuch a caſe, and the hole, where the ſplinter went in, is no bigger than a pins head, yea, you hardly can diſcern, whether any thing entered or no, and you cannot feel with your finger any pricking thing, then let it alone, feel not into, unleſs by a ſure ſign you know that ſomething is in it: in caſe you have no certain ſign of it, then apply the unknown Plaiſter a hand-breadth over it, and leave vent about a Dollers breadth at the hole, there apply the ſtiptick plaiſter, as if it were a thorough wounded bone-fracture, bind it not too hard, elſe you cauſe a ſwelling at the Joynt, and in caſe it is ſwelled, then make vent, keep it not too ſtiffe with binding, that you may ſee, whether it inclineth to ſwelling, and where it is thin, and where it caſts up a bile, and maketh a blew mark: be not too haſty here, at another time you may be ſurer, whether any thing be in it or no; if ſo, then lance it, and preſs it forth, and proceed as you think good.</p>
                  <p>Being that lancing is not alwayes good, I alwayes ſtayed for a fitter time, and had no mind to lancing, alwayes hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it better, that for four dayes ſome pains ſhould be felt, rather than to cauſe greater pains for two dayes, and I am ſtill
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106818:71"/> of that opinion. For if the ſplinter can neither be ſeen nor felt, what need then of groaping? It cannot alwayes be hid, it will find its place one time or another. Some uſe to take Hares greaſe, and Bone-marrow, and apply it to the Wound: and others do it another way, every one thinks his own to be the beſt: but for my part I uſed the ſtiptick Plaiſter, as you heard afore: if it comes forth, well and good, if not, I let it alone, uſing no Tents, let it have its own working to caſt it out. Some uſe ſwelling Tents and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, others uſe Corroſives, others fall to lancing: let every one have his will, what I Write, I Write for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen ſplinters, and took them forth, which had ſtaid ſome years in the fleſh, the parties notknowing how they came into it, feeling no pain, till at laſt when the ſplinter roſe, and I thought it had been a looſe bone, neither did the party know what it ſhould be, but at the opening it proved a long ſplinter, which was as clear, as if lately broken off from the wood.</p>
                  <p>It happened, that one leaning on a Pin-cuſhion, a needle run into his Finger, and a piece of it brake off, his Daughter complained that her needle was broken, made him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, at the preſent he felt it not, neither regarded it; in ſound fleſh for a time it may not be felt, and cauſe no pain for the preſent: The thing that I would ſay here is this, that ſuch Wounds ſhould not be metled with, as long as they are not painful, and ſtay the time, when they cauſe pains.</p>
                  <p>And I have ſeen a ſplinter riſing upwards in the fleſh, as well as downward: Iron and Lead alwayes tendeth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and heavy things, that ſink in water, do the like in the Body, and light things, that ſwim on the water, the ſame climb upwards alſo in the Body, if there be a way for it.</p>
                  <p>The ſplinter which is gone into the Body, if green, it may be pulled out and laid hold on with a Skrue, or a skrued Bullet-tong, or Corn-tong, or with the Seeker; and if you are about any ſuch thing, do it nimbly, elſe the wood ſwels in the fleſh, groweth big, and you can no more get it out,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106818:72"/> where it ſofteneth and rotteth, and no Inſtrument can take hold of it, and the Joynt ſwels; therefore be quick and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IF you have a Patient, whoſe Hand or Finger is wounded, and ſomething is looſe in it, and the ligaments are cut in pieces; here have a care, that the Joynt be not hurt or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at your dreſſing. Some have Hands made of wood, and others have caſes, in which they lay the wounded Members to reſt, ſuch things I approve and commend, I had none ſuch, I uſed ſplinters, as it is the faſhion about broken bones which I fitted for the Arms, Hands, Fingers, according as I had occaſion; theſe ſplinters were like ſuch, as I uſed to Bone-fractures. For I ſhall ſhew you, how I faſhioned theſe ſplinters, in the form of a Member or Joynt, and fitted them ſo, that they hurt or toucht no where, and lay on cloſe, and they fitted very well, and looked handſome, and were either of a ſleeve faſhion, or of a finger caſe, taking juſt meaſure; having prepared them well, then firſt I applied the red unknown Plaiſter about the Wound, ſo that it incloſed round the Joynt, and made it lie ſmooth, for if the Plaiſter runs together, you will hardly get it aſunder; therefore keep them aſunder a ſtraws breadth, and not let them cloſe, nor come one over another, elſe the skins or ſplinters could hardly be changed without great moiling; and when they are at this diſtance, they are the eaſier taken off from the skin, &amp; the Joynt muſt not be ſtirred nor pulled much, when the Plaiſter comes off uneaſily. Therefore be warned, you do not let the Plaiſter come together, be it on the Fingers joynt or elſewhere, you may lay a double Plaiſter of courſe cloth to the Joynt, then the Plaiſters ſtick cloſe like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106818:72"/> and the Joynt is under it immoveable. The Plaiſter's being doubled, let them be at a further diſtance, elſe you will hardly get them off from the body; and when I intended to let a Plaiſter lie long, and not to take it off in haſte, then I ſpread ſome of the ſaid Salve or Ointment on the ſplinters, then they held ſtrongly and I tied two laths about it or more, as I ſaw need for it; and when I laid any ſuch bands to it, I took heed, that I toucht not the Plaiſter. The uſe will teach you more, how theſe laths and ſplinters muſt be laid, they muſt not cover the Wound, but it muſt be as in a bone-fracture it is uſed: Above the bolſter and band you lay them to the Wound, at laſt lay on lath, and ſo bind it to, as you think fit. And doing thus, be it the Finger, Hand, Arm, Leg, then you may look to it twice or oftner in a day, that the Joynt doth not move, and is at better reſt, then if it were every day ſtirred and taken out of the caſe, or lifted; you need not fear any Impoſthumations to fall into the Wound. In caſe ſuch laths and ſplinters are not uſed, becauſe no Joint or bone was in pieces, nevertheleſs I applied the red un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Plaiſter, by reaſon of Impoſthumes and Swellings of the Joynt, alwayes leaving vent for the Wound, as there was need of. When you lay clothes over the Plaiſter, then firſt lay a bolſter upon the Plaiſter, then the other clothes will not ſtick to the Plaiſter, thus the eaſier you may open and bind it. I let this Plaiſter lie ſometimes ten dayes long, in caſe it was not waſhed much. On a Fracture I let it lie ſomewhat longer; and on the Knee it muſt lie longer, as I ſhall ſhew it in Fractures of bones and Knees: when you place the Patient into the plaiſter and bands, you may lift him immoveably as you pleaſe.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SUrgeons many times undertake a cure, which is of no great weight or conſequence; ſometimes the Hand is ſwelled, and ſometimes it is not, but the great ſinews of the Arm is crackt, and the party is not able to lift any thing; and it paineth him when he worketh; he aileth nothing, but that his ſinews are crackt. If you dreſs him with the red Plaiſter, as a Fracture is dreſſed, then the crackt ſinews joyn again, even as a Fracture in a bone doth; but if you onely annoint, and not bind him, he will not be cured in haſte; ſuch like Patients I had many. But you need not dreſs him with many laths or ſuch like, one lath or ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſerve the turn here. And apply that lath either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or below the great ſinew on the Arm, another within the Arm, and better is it, to appply one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove than below the ſinew, and ſo tie it ſtiffely, then the great ſinew joyneth, and the ſinew water is conſumed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger.</p>
                  <p>If a party was beaten, or had a fall, without a Wound or Fracture, I dreſſed him in this manner, as you heard of the crackt Joynts, then the congealed bloud could not gather nor putrifie, and the blew and yellow colour was gone: I annointed them ſometimes with Dialthaea, that it ſhould be the more ſupple, and uſed no laths or ſplinters, but onely dreſt the Hand with the red Plaiſter, and needed no further toil; ſome I dreſt but once, ſome twice, and at the moſt three times.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Knees that are full of pains, and how they are cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Will write now of Knees that are much pained, &amp; do look like other found Knees, yet are full of pains continually, without ceaſing day and night, and grow untoward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaped: Of theſe there are ſeveral ſorts, ſome are with a fall, blow, thruſt, caſts, and other wayes thus lamed; others were ſound at day time, and at night they fell lame, ſwelled and greatly pained in their Knees: Of theſe I ſhould write ſeverally; of ſuch Patients I had enough, had great care and toil with them. I have lanced more than a hundred of ſuch Knees, beſides thoſe I had cured otherwiſe, and not opened them: I call my Journymen and Apprentices to witneſs, which dwelt a long time with me, that I ſtill was troubled to cure ſuch Knees, two or three Patients in one day, whoſe Knees were ſo full of matter, that it was to be wondered at. And God hath given a great bleſſing unto ſuch cures, whoſe Name be praiſed for ever.</p>
                  <p>If any one was lamed in his Knee, either by a throw, fall, blow, &amp;c. and it was ſwelled, which ſwelling was not long there, but even newly come on, theſe I cured ſo; firſt I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my red Plaiſter in a great and broad way, onely leaving free the tendons or hamſtrings, and bound it well with roul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to keep off ſwellings, and the Sinew water from gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from feſtering. I did not undreſs the party in four or five dayes, neither did I much annoint the party, onely kept the Joynt free from ſimptoms; thus all ill humours were exſiccated.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſimply I dreſt the Knees, which order I do keep even to this preſent time, neither did I hitherto here of any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way. Sure I am, I have dreſt above a hundred ſuch Knees; at the taking off of the one Plaiſter I applied another, not troubling the Patients with any other things, and ſo cured them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame proceſs I uſed to Elbows, Shoulders, Hands,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106818:74"/> Ankles, Fingers. Briefly, all parts wounded and hurt by a fall, blow, throw, thruſt, &amp;c. Fractures and Wounds, never altered the cure.</p>
                  <p>Further, if any had ugly Knees, full of hardneſs and pains, I proceeded in the ſame manner with them, and with coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Sinews and other ſtiffe parts; I never could hear of any better thing theſe ſeven and thirty yeares, and as long as I followed this Profeſſion; and if I ſhould continue it as long again, I do not beleive that ever I ſhould change it: and as many Knees as I have lanced, I ſtill applied that ſame Plaiſter, healing it toward the Body up, and down to the Leg, and bound it well above and below the Knee with a broad rouler: ſomewhat I left open about the Wound, like an open Fracture, which I undreſt and dreſt again, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required a lanced Wound ſhould be dreſt: I let lie the applied Plaiſters, as they uſe to do on a Rupture, and dreſt them twice a day, even as I thought good, and the Joynt could not riſe, by reaſon of the applied Plaiſter, becauſe the Plaiſter would not ſuffer any thing to preſs or thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the hollowneſs and ſwelling never roſe higher. I had alſo many Knees in cure, which were very hard, and would not be ſtirred, having a lameneſs, biles and other ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and Joynt-ſponges grew therein, and exiccations of the Joynts.</p>
                  <p>All theſe I dreſt with the ſaid Plaiſter, tied them ſtrongly, and preſt the hardneſs downward below the Knee, driving it down to the Leg, then the Knee began to leſſen, onely the Shin and Foot ſwelled, for the which I applied warm clothes, and ſometimes I perfumed theſe warm clothes with Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, then the Legs ſwelling was gone alſo, and that internal moiſture was exiccated without any danger. Theſe parties were ſo cured, that they needed not any other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſome Knees came to my cure, full of lameneſs, biles and joynt-ſponges, ſuch I cured in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>When the Knee was hard and ugly, then I bound it ſtrongly all the Joynt over, and mollified it, and was careful
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106818:74"/> to ſee where the joyntwater would appear; and having found it in a ripeneſs, being gathered under the band, and there alſo, where it appeared firſt, and there alſo, where it never was, then I took care, where it might be beſt to open it, and took hold on the matter, where I was ſure it was, which I let run out as clear as water, not mingled with matter or bloud, and that water looked as clear as Well water. In caſe I could not come ſo nigh as to get the water out at one cut, lying yet under the knee-pan, then I cut onely through the skin, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a little hole, putting in a Wick rould in Allom or other Corroſive, and ſtill eat a deeper and broader Wound with Corroſives, till I came to the water: For it is ſure enough, if you hit and meet with the water, it guſheth forth, as the bloud doth out of a breathed vein. It often happened to me, that I was fain to ſet the baſon farther off, when it guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth in this manner: one time it guſhed into my Mans face, ſcarce able to hold the baſon, ſo fiercely came it running. Having let out this water, then I dreſt him with a Tent and Ointment, every day thrice, like an open Fracture: Once I lanced a young Mans Knee, the water guſhed out ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, that none of it run down his Legs, till at the end, when they were empty. I know not one but he was healed, if any water was found therein: and I had good ſucceſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon thoſe which I dreſt with bands and roulers; and when I was about the lancing of any Knee, <hi>I</hi> did it ſo, that the Patient was no where endangered thereby. <hi>I</hi> never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened any with a Knife or other inſtruments, but onely with that Lancet <hi>I</hi> uſed to phlebotomize withal, making no great inciſion, onely of ſuch a bigneſs that <hi>I</hi> might get in a Tent. Further <hi>I</hi> did ſo, <hi>I</hi> dropped one drop of Ointment on the place where <hi>I</hi> meant to cut, and was ſure, that in that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs the water did lie; and having thus marked it with a drop, then <hi>I</hi> took a long rouler and bound the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, and then <hi>I</hi> ſtruck upward above the marked place, then <hi>I</hi> laid another band, tied it ſtrongly, ſo that the skin roſe on high, and made it inſenſible with the ſtiffe and hard binding, and raiſed it ſo high, that <hi>I</hi> knew <hi>I</hi> could not hurt him, and to come onely to the hollowneſs with the iron,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106818:75"/> and it hurt the Patient not ſo much, as it would if the place had not been tied, neither could it ſlide away under the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, it muſt ſtand to it, and it could not but be hit and ſurely found.</p>
                  <p>Now is it time here to conſider, what ſores <hi>I</hi> mean to be opened on the Knees and Elbows.</p>
                  <p>Note, <hi>I</hi> mean not ſuch Knees or other Members, which are full of matter, or other ſwellings filled up with ſcirroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but onely ſuch that are full of water, and are ſoft, and by that water are brought to a lameneſs; of ſuch <hi>I</hi> had a great many; neither are they marked with any weakneſs or defect, onely they complain of it, when they go, or ſtand ſtill, and at mornings near the breaking of the day they are moſt pained, neither do they feel any great pain when touched, onely there they are pained where the water lieth, and is ſwelled a little, no other ſign to be ſeen. It is hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how it guſheth out at the cutting; but if tied it ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out, as when a vein is breathed, but no bloud cometh with it.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch Knees would not yeild to any ſoftneſs under the Plaiſter, though they were much annointed, and troubled with Cataplaſms of <hi>Althea, Malva,</hi> Greaſe, &amp;c. hot Wines, Oyls, Sweatings, Fomentations, Coolings and chiefly Water-baths, all which were hurtful, and rather cauſed the growing of a Joynt-ſponge. When they were ſo hard, and ſhapleſs, and unmoveable (for the aboveſaid Medicines make them ſtiffe, tough, hanging and clingling:) then <hi>I</hi> was forced to do what <hi>I</hi> was loath to do; and ſeeing that the thing muſt be opened, namely, the top and the higheſt part of the bile, and put ſome Corroſive into the Wound, and made it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry every day more and more, till the hardneſs was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then I dreſt him, as any other Wound of the Knee ought to be dreſſed; after it was ſomewhat healed, <hi>I</hi> applied the red Plaiſter alſo, and ſo exiccated the reſt, as <hi>I</hi> uſually did to Knees not lanced: <hi>I</hi> often bowed, out-ſtretched and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, fitting them for motion, for the fleſh ſticketh ſo cloſe to the healing, that it will hardly admit any ſtirring, therefore by force they muſt be ſtretched, bowed and bound,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106818:75"/> as hereafter ſhall be ſpoken of at crooked joynts. Note alſo, that a Mercurial Ointment is good for lameneſs and pocky biles, if his foot be annointed with it, or it is better, if laid into it, for the Pox and lame blains come ſometimes onely into the Knee, though no where elſe, but men are loath to hear, that theſe are cauſed by that <hi>Morbus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other ſtrange hurts on the Knees, more than to the whole Body may come, and differ ſo much, that no body can tell what they are, and I beleive there is no man, who knoweth them all.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſome humours of the Body, which ſtink, and fall down upon the Knees, of which many periſh and die, and I ſay not that theſe may be cured; for beſides the miſery, pains, ſtink, putrefaction of the bones and ſinews, there grow Worms therein, which fall from thence, and to ſpeak truly, theſe ought to be cut off, and the Patient be ready for death.</p>
                  <p>And my counſel is to you Novices in Surgery, not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake alone to cure Knees, unleſs you know firſt, what accident there is in it, whether it come by a hurt, or whether it accrue to it, for an accrued hurt is worſe than one that is made; and an accrued ſimptom hath a root, which if it be ſtirred and rouſed, a dangerours excreſcence may be cauſed, and the root not known. But things proceeding from the Pox, which are running, are bad enough to be cured, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they break forth of their own accord, for then they are worſe than when they are opened; for when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſeek to come forth, they ſearch then many places betwixt the veins and ſinews, and ſtay there, and have many paſſages and wayes; and when a Surgeon thinks he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at his journeys end, then is he onely at the beginning, and can hardly come near it, and fals out many times, that the true ground can never be had, and then bodily humours come alſo, which come from ill Lungs, and fall down from the <hi>Diaphragme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover take care, and underſtand me right, that you will have perhaps cauſe in ſore Knees to make uſe of a leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife, by reaſon of the ſwelling and the water which is in it,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106818:76"/> which ought not to be uſed. Uſe no mollifying things made of Althaea, Mallows, Honey, Meal, Lin ſeed, Butter, Greaſe, and ſuch like, &amp;c. for I do not adviſe, that any ſoftning things ſhould be applied to Knees, but to let Nature have her courſe; and if Nature be too weak to expel, then aid her with a Lancet, make a hole, which is to be made wider with a Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, or burnt Allom, which is enough, I uſed no more. Here I ſpeak of hard and not of ſoft Knees, for when they are ſoft, then they ſoon ripen unto matter or water.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe Knees that raiſe and ſwell, and have many red pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels here and there, they raiſe, but ſwell not, and is called the Roſe. Theſe ought not at all to be annointed, much leſs muſt any greaſineſs or moiſture come to it, onely dry warm clothes muſt be applied unto, which dry up all their damps. Some do foment thoſe, and I uſed ſuch means alſo, and me thinks it doth very well. This Roſe or <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire muſt be ſo dealt withal, and that ſwelling or raiſing goeth away without any peril, if onely kept warm with dry clothes. Theſe Knees muſt be tied pretty ſtiffely, that the Knee-pan do not raiſe too much. It is good to bind a Knee hard, as much as the Patient is able to bear, be it in any infirmity whatſoever, except when there are gray blains or bliſters at hand, theſe ought not to be bound, that the ſooner and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they may come to their ripeneſs, for they grow and ſwell till they be ripe.</p>

                        <hi>Of ſome humours of the Body, which ſink down into the Knees and Legs; what theſe are, and how they muſt be cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe hurts and ſimptoms of the Knees are ſeveral; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt there is a malignant humor, running down from the Body, making a paſſage through the Thigh to the hollow Knee by the ſinews, which humour ſtinketh, and is like to matter, and white like Whey, there it ſtayeth, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no cure, it is one of the worſt humours, and I never heard, that any was cured of it, either by fomenting, woods, lancing, cooking, or by other manuals, nor by potions, or corroſives, but it kept its courſe, which it hath from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy downward, and the paſſage it made is hardly found out. Therefore I adviſe you, not to attempt much upon it, but onely keep theſe Knees clean, that they may ſtink the leſs.</p>
                  <p>There are other ſharp humours alſo, of the nature of a ſalt rheum, which fall down from the Body upon veins and ſinews, and theſe alſo have their revelets and paſſages. Theſe corrode and gnaw the bones into a black colour, and cauſe more pains than the former, and are very hardly cured, yet through good counſel and good diet they may, and muſt be held to the Wood cure; and if they are cured, it is done with inconvenience, by cutting or taking out of bones; if theſe rheums are taken off, and their condition changed through a good diet, then theſe ſharp rheumes are conſumed and gone, and may the eaſier and better be healed than the other above named.</p>
                  <p>There are other rheums alſo in the Body, which fall on the bones above like great Impoſthumes and ſwellings, where they putrifie, and ſink till they come to the Knee, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth nought, ſome of theſe rheums have their ſupply from the Body, but theſe are neither ſtinking nor corroding, as the other two ſorts named above are, and theſe run moſt round
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106818:77"/> about the bones, before they come to any maturity, and fill the Legs with matter, and are eaſily cured, if come to a full ripeneſs, and when they have mollified the fleſh and skin, then muſt they be opened, and a cleanſer put in, and let the rheum run out, let it not reſt one quarter of an hour in its running, and let the party have a conſtant dreſſing, applying Tents and Plaiſters, let the hollowneſs be not much covered with fleſh, that the Muſcles and the skin together with the pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may cloſe the better, for theſe do willingly cloſe, for that reaſon they muſt not be filled up with fleſh, and muſt be tied ſtiffely, then the hollowneſs healeth together; therefore ſit your Wicks ſo, that the moiſture may run out by it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at the one place or ſinew to the other; for I held it not good, when I pulled out a Tent, that the matter followed cloſe, if the matter is run out before the Tent is pulled out, then is it more wholeſome when no matter followeth after the Tent. The Patient muſt not alwayes lie ſtill, but muſt turn himſelf this and that way, that the matter ſettle not any where. The Tent that is to be put in muſt be covered with Aegyptiacum, or with a Wound-ointment, as you ſee cauſe for it. You may ſiringe him a little, and that gently: Uſe no Gliſters, they cauſe windineſs, which bringeth danger. But ſiringing is good, and the Balſam and Ointment cometh the better into: and the ſimptom being inwardly well cleanſed, and the ſwelling allayed, then dreſs the opened hole with the Ointment and Plaiſter, then you will know, whether any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſettled, it raiſes then like dough: you need not to put the Patient to any pain, nor to make any hole, for it will run out freely when you dreſs him with the rouler, and apply the red Plaiſter over that dough or ſoftened place, and if it thruſts againſt, as the matter uſually doth, and you are ſure of the matter, then you may lance it, which will be good, thereby the matter will take its courſe, and let the firſt little Wound be healed up as faſt as you can, and bind it ſtrongly. And the neathermoſt hole muſt have vent, and be kept open, till to the laſt of the healing. Let the Knee not lie ſtill and reſt, but ſtretch and bow it as much as you can, that it grow not lame. For if you ſtay till all be healed, then will it be too
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106818:78"/> late for the Knee to be ſtirred. Therefore do it betimes what you ought to do, that the Knee be not healed ſtiffe. For if you ſtay too long, and neither bow nor out-ſtretch the Knee, then you will hardly help it afterward, and it will be a great difficulty to bring it to right. For if you deal rightly, and heal it well in the joyning of it, then the party will be of a ſound and ſtrong body, for all the dangerous humidity which was in all the body, was expelled through this ſtrong humour. I have ſeen, that all thoſe which were cured of ſuch humours grew ſtrong and ſound men.</p>
                  <p>There are other humours which fall into the Knee, even <note place="margin">A humor like the Roſe, but worſe.</note> as the Roſe or <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire uſeth to fall, and with ſuch a cold as the Plague doth, and looks like unto this Roſe or <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire, but is ſomewhat worſe, having blew ſpots, as the Roſe hath red ones, but the blew ones are not ſo big, but are of that bigneſs as the black bliſters are, and this redneſs is altogether nought, for it is a flour of the cold Fire: But if that Member hath great help from the body, then it doth not ſo much hurt, for there fall little holes into thoſe bliſters; and when their skins are pulled off, their matter looks black, and fals out, and theſe are eaſily healed, but are worſe than the <hi>Anthonies</hi> Fire is, and ought not to be made wet, neither muſt they be annointed, but kept onely warm and dry, as long as the redneſs and the black bliſters hold, then plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are applied unto them, as other little holes uſually are healed.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Dogs bliſters, very like unto the above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <note place="margin">Dogs bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> but not ſo dangerous, and they make the Knees ſwell, theſe alſo ought not to be made wet.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo on the Knees laming humours, which are of a difficult healing, make deep impreſſions, cauſe a great deal <note place="margin">Laming Humours.</note> of trouble, and are not eaſily turned or diverted, and do not ſhew from whence their original is; the pain they cauſe is juſt in the middle of the Knee, with a little ſwelling, and ſtand on the Knee-pan, there ſeemeth to be ſtore of filth in it, but is not, onely the pain is apparent; there is a ſinew and lame water, which can neither be ſoftened nor ripened, even like the water which is in a Joynt, as we heard above: much
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106818:78"/> pain uſually creepleth and maketh the Knee crooked, or ſhrinks it, eſpecially toward the day. My conſtant practiſe was to dreſs and bind them dry, ſtrongly and warm, to keep the Pores open. No greaſie things, no Ointments, no wet things I uſed thereunto, after I had well learned the ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but my red Plaiſter I ſtill applied, and warm clothes. And as I ſhewed at the great Bands, to keep things there in a ſweat, ſo theſe lame biles alſo will ſteal away; for if Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſweat well under the Plaiſter, they will doubtleſe be healed, and tie the places hard, though it makes the foot ſwell it matters not, for that ſoon allayeth and goeth away, if kept warm with clothes, even as other humours are expelled by keeping open the Pores.</p>

                        <hi>Of Wounds made by Gun-ſhot; of the abuſes committed with the thorough pullings and Ointments: what a Surgeon ought to note here.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANy ſhot that went thorough Mans body is held mortal, <note place="margin">Wounds made with ſhot.</note> becauſe the internal parts are ſpoiled and hurt by that heat; ſuch Wounds are not eaſily cured: of theſe I intend not to treat, nor of ſuch, where the ſhot hath carried all away, which things can neither be filled nor ſet on. We will ſpeak here, how to quench ſuch burnings, and how ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations are to be prevented, ſo that that burning cauſe no further miſchief than the ſhot hath made, and then how Surgeons in ſuch particulars are to regulate themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The condition of one that is ſhot is this; ſome bullets <note place="margin">Bullets ſtay, or penetrate the Body.</note> ſtay in the Wound, or elſe go quite through; if gone quite through, then the cure is this, that the burning be quenched, becauſe if that prevaileth, it cauſeth more hurt than the ſhot hath done.</p>
                  <p>But if the bullet ſtaid in the Wound, then it muſt be taken <note place="margin">When a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſtayes?</note> out, but how that is done, is not well poſſible to ſet down
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106818:79"/> every particular; for ſhots are made ſeveral wayes, the one is not like the other, a whole book could be written of it; Experience muſt ſhew the way, how they are to be dealt withal; and ſo here you muſt go to ſchool and learn.</p>
                  <p>The Antients indeed have uſed hereunto many ſtrange Screws and Inſtruments, and were very careful herein. But theſe are either of no uſe, or of very little. For if the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let cannot be laid hold on by the Inſtrument, how ſhall it be gotten out? The bullet will ſtrive to get out at the Wound, if the Patient be laid downward with the Wound, or elſe by its ſinking it will come to a place, where it may be cut out; if none of theſe can be, Experience muſt ſhew you another way.</p>
                  <p>Touching Wounds where the bullet went through; here I muſt ſhew the dangerous abuſes which Surgeons commit; if they have a Patient that is ſhot through a Member, they take hempen threed, or ſome twiſted hair, which rotteth leſs, and draw it through the Wound, let it hang out on both ends, they put their cooling Ointments to it before they draw it thorough; and when they come to dreſs the Patient again then they pull the threeds forth, and beſmear it afreſh with their cooling Ointment, and then they draw it through again, that part of the threed which ſtaid in the Wound they make very clean, from that it gathered in the Wound; then they apply their Plaiſters to the Wound, as they think they are fitting.</p>
                  <p>With theſe thorough-drawings (as they call it) they <note place="margin">Thorough-drawings do more hurt than good.</note> ſuppoſe to have done great good. Nay, ſome are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this is the onely way to dreſs and heal Wounds made with ſhots.</p>
                  <p>But it is otherwiſe: For they do not effect ſo much with theſe thorough drwaings as they think, for the hurt weighed with the good, that is done thereby, it will be apparent, that more hurt is done than good, and ought to be omitted alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>For ſuch a cord or line drawn through the Wound muſt <note place="margin">Hurts done with the thorough-drawings.</note> needs cauſe great pains, and that not onely at the firſt, but at the ſeveral dreſſings. This way were leſs dangerous, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106818:79"/> the leſs refuſeable, if the ſhot had hurt no ſinews and bloud veines; but this being very ſeldom, I hold, this ſcouring ſhould be omitted. For it often fals out, when a bloud vein is hurt, and hath ſtencht her ſelf, this thorough pulling cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in her a freſh bleeding, which bloud ſtayeth within and cauſeth no good. And in caſe a ſinew be hurt-in that Wound, then this line muſt needs hurt the wounded ſinew at the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dreſſings, and ſtir it at this pulling or drawing, which doubtleſs is not done without cauſing of great pains, and thereby the worſt ſimptoms are occaſioned. For theſe and many other reaſons, which I could alledge here, I hold this thorough-drawings to be a very dangerous abuſe, and count the following way, which I made uſe of, far better, as being an eaſier and ſlighter way, cauſing leſs pains an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> dangers, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſimptoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It may be objected here, that ſuch cords draw out the filth which the fire hath left in the Wound, and the Wound is throughly cleanſed within?</p>
                  <p>It may do ſo; but in reſpect of other inconveniences, pains, dangers, whereby ſome Patients are quite ſpoiled, I hold it for nought. For Nature is her own beſt Phyſitian, and deſires to be aided in theſe things, which are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto her; and the matter, burnt fleſh, bloud, &amp;c. through Natures help ſeparateth of its own accord, and Nature ought to be helped herein with convenient meanes, as you ſhall here hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the burning or fire being quenched, then there is no more need, but that Nature be aſſiſted, and that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, which the fire in the Wound hath ſpoiled, the which is eaſier and ſooner done through the following Medicines, better than with all their thorough-drawings.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs give a hint here of the cooling Ointments, <note place="margin">Abuſes in the Coolers committed.</note> which ſome Surgeons prepare, of Oyle and other ſhorty and greaſie things: Though indeed they do no hurt, and in that reſpect I reject them not: But there is one thing in the way, at which I am offended, and muſt needs ſpeak of. All fat things, be they what they will, grow hot ſuddenly and cool ſlowly. Muſt now ſuch a cooling Ointment be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106818:80"/> into the Wound, where the bullet ſticks, either in the bone or in the fleſh, whilſt it is yet hot? Surely that Wound muſt needs be more inflamed thereby? Beſides this will enſue alſo, when ſuch Ointments are poured into the Wound, the Patient muſt endure the more ſmarting paines, eſpecially when the bullet is ſtill hot &amp; warm in the Wound. Therefore I hold it to be better, to uſe means which cauſe leſs pains, for it is uſual, that to pained places worſe things are incident. But where there is no pain, there the Wound ſettleth the ſooner unto reſt.</p>
                  <p>As for the healing of ſuch Wounds, I will tell you what I found to be good, not that there ſhould not be other cures for them, but onely that the courteous Reader may ſee, that I and others have endeavoured to the utmoſt, that hurts and dangers might be prevented, and the good of all Patients promoted.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe firſt thing belonging to ſuch Cures is, that the bullet be taken out, and I gave a hint of my meaning for it in the precedent Chapter, and let it reſt thereby.</p>
                  <p>Touching the burning and fire in the Wound, to quench it, you may note the following things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when the fire in the Wound is at the higheſt, prepare an Ointment of Honey, and not of Oyl or other greaſie things, ſpout it into the Wound three or four times, or any other way you can beſt get it in, and moiſten all places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, even the bullet alſo if it be in it. Then take a Tent of Gum Tragadanth, annoint it with the ſaid Wound-ointment, and thruſt it into the Wound. But if the Wound be ſhot quite thorough, then you muſt uſe two of theſe Tents, be they ſhort or long, as the occaſion of the Wound requireth, let the Tent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be thin and not thick, that they may the eaſier be put
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106818:80"/> in; at laſt apply a good ſtiptick Plaiſter upon, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of its operation.</p>
                  <p>Then miniſter to the Patient of prepared Saltpeter <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs (which follows hereafter) in freſh Well water, or according unto occaſion, ſirrup of Violets, or of Sloe-thorn floures, miniſter to the Patient without delay, of this you may give before you dreſs him, the fire within will the ſooner be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed and quenched; for outward means do not alwayes quench ſuch fire, inward things muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the pain of this burning will not ceaſe in two or three hours, then undreſs the Wound, and dreſs it again, and let him have one drachm more of the prepared Saltpeter, ſurely that burning will ceaſe in a ſhort time: If it be not yet quenched, then try the third time, and be provided with a better thing. In the mean while let the Patient drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let him not be oppreſt with thirſt; the raw Water is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than if boyled; but things cannot alwayes be had in readineſs: If inwardly a Joynt or Principal part be hurt in the Wound, at which you cannot come with the Medicine; of ſuch Wounds <hi>I</hi> will not ſpeak here, becauſe they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mortal.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt pain being gone, then another Cooler may <note place="margin">After burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> be uſed, made of Oyls or fat things, as you ſhall find here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and that may be done ſafely; onely my adviſe is, not to meddle with oyly things at firſt, for reaſons ſpoken of before.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that when all the fierineſs and burning is gone, Phlebotomy will be of good uſe in ſuch places, as the Wound will permit, and that is to be done when the fire is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but if you do it before that, then you do nothing, but make the fire to prevail the more and get the predominancy, for I found it ſo by experience.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the great pain and burning holdeth ſtill, and is not quite ceaſed, and the Wound alſo doth not purge out its <note place="margin">When a Wound it poyſoned.</note> filth, and groweth redder and redder round about the brim, and the Patient be thereby the more weakened, from thence you may argue, that the Wound is fallen into a venomous ſimptom. Now is it neceſſary to let the Patient have a draught of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> (deſcribed in the Chapter of Wound-diſeaſes)
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106818:81"/> and let him ſweat, being well covered. For what is ſuch a Wound, thus burned by Gun-powder, but a venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wound? And in caſe you cannot have the aforeſaid <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> in lieu thereof take good Mithridate or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and let the Patient ſweat upon. For I found it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that with ſuch ſweating the heat was taken off, and quenched, more than with the beſt Medicines outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; the Patient may be thus ſweated twice or thrice: In the interim neglect not the Wound, and dreſs it as it ought.</p>
                  <p>As Wounds are ſeveral and different, ſo their Cures alſo <note place="margin">Difference in Wounds.</note> muſt be according. Some Wounds are cured onely with outward means, if timely and orderly uſed; other Wounds require alſo inward Medicaments, without which they are not cured.</p>
                  <p>Therefore vulnerary Potions, which I ſhall teach you, are not to be rejected, to expel the filth from the bloud and fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Patients diet, you heard of it before, which I will not repeat here, onely let me tell of the Medicaments, I made mention of formerly, how they ought to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">To make Coolers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make the Cooler do thus: ℞ Honey lb 2. the juice of Houſleek lb ſs juice of Crefiſhes five ounces, Roſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar ſix ounces, phlegm of Vitriol five ounces; mingle all theſe; ſcum it well in the boyling let it be a little thinner then Honey; thus is it right.</p>
                  <p>The juice of Crefiſhes is made thus, ℞ Oflive Crefiſhes lb 1. beat them in a morter, preſs out the ſap.</p>
                  <p>Phlegm of Vitriol is the diſtilled water from Vitriol, at the drawing off the ſpirit of it: Of theſe in the Chapter of Cramp and Palſie, &amp;c. more ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>This is a good Cooler, it quencheth the fire preſently, it muſt ſtand and go no further, and the fire muſt ſeparate the ſooner from the ſound part. It is not onely good againſt the fire, the Gun-powder left in the Wound, but other burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo, cauſed by Wood, Water, Oyl, Iron, Tin, Lead, Gold, &amp;c. if the burnt place be annointed with it, then a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106818:81"/> ſtiptick Plaiſter applied to it, will do very well.</p>
                  <p>This fire being quenched, and the pain allayed, then milder Medicines muſt be uſed, which mitigate the Wound, and help to expel the reſt.</p>
                  <p>I will teach you one or two I made uſe of my ſelf:</p>
                  <p>℞ Wax four ounces, melt it on a gentle fire, add to it of freſh Butter one ounce, of Lin ſeed oyl two ounces; all theſe being well melted, then pour it forth into a pewter diſh, in which be water of plantain, or Roſes; ſtir it well about, make it hot again, conſume away the Water, pour it again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the diſh, ſtir it well about, then ſet the diſh on a place to warm, ſtir it ſtill, then all the water will be gone, ſtir among it of Bole half an ounce, then is the Ointment prepared for to get out the fire, let it lie as deep as it will; the Wound muſt be often dreſt with it at the beginning, and the Plaiſter before ſpoken of applied to it.</p>

                  <p>Thus much of cooling Ointments, becauſe it is known enough how cooling Ointments are made.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth ſometimes, that though the fire be quenched and expelled, yet the Wound doth not heal, and is at a ſtand. In ſuch a caſe uſe the following remedy. <note place="margin">In caſe the Wound healeth not.</note>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106818:82"/> of Litharge of Silver a quarter of an ounce, oyl of Roſes half a pound, of Wax four ounces, of Frankincenſe one drachm, mingle all theſe, and make an Ointment of it.</p>
                  <p>There are many Simples found alſo, which take out the <note place="margin">Simples that are good alſo in that caſe.</note> fire, and are of a ſanatife quality, <hi>viz,</hi> red and white Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Soladel, and many more of that kind. And ſome Animals alſo are good, <hi>viz.</hi> Frogs, Geeſe, &amp;c. of theſe I ſpeak no more here, Surgery being of a greater concernment with the Manuals and Experience in it, more than great pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting come too.</p>
                  <p>An expert Surgeon, according to skill and Experience, will <note place="margin">Manuals &amp; Experience is beſt in Surgeons.</note> find more things than conveniently may be ſet down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when, where and how is to order and alter his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and to make them milder or ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>This I will teach you, how the aforeſaid Saltpeter is to be <note place="margin">To prepare Saltpeter for Wounds made by ſhot.</note> prepared for Wounds made with ſhot, and how Tents are to be made and uſed, becauſe the preparation is not known to every one.</p>
                  <p>Firſt touching the Saltpeter, its preparation is thus; its naughty humidity is to be taken from it, and a better reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it, that it may ſafely be uſed for the good of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it is of a good ſcent, it quencheth thirſt, it allayeth heat, provoketh urine, and is endowed with many good qualities, not known to every one.</p>
                  <p>Its preparation is thus: ℞ Of the pureſt clarified Peter two ounces, put it in a pot, and make a circular fire about, let it be melted, it being melted, put a little quantity of purified Sulpher to it, that being flamed away, then caſt more into, till a quarter of an ounce be burnt in it, the Sulpher clarifieth the Peter; and when it is purified enough, caſt it forth, and pulveriſe it, and put it into a Bag or <hi>Manica Hypocratis,</hi> put Roſe water to it, and make a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> this Lie boyl away half, let it cool and ſhoot into Criſtals, which you keep for uſe; boil away the moiety of the remaining water, let it cool and ſhoot again; pulveriſe the Criſtals, keep them from the air in a glaſs for uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Tents formerly mentioned are made thus:</p>
                  <p>℞ The juyce of Speedwel rectified through Wooll, two
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106818:82"/> ounces, Gum Tragacanth purely beaten half an ounce, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and reduce it to a pap, let it ſtand in a warm place, it will be like dough, then take lint of Silk, roul it in this pap on a pewter plate, and keep theſe Wicks for uſe. Note, theſe muſt be made of a pretty bigneſs, becauſe in their drying they grow leſs; when they are dry, and you have need to uſe them, then take one, cover it with your cooling Ointment' and put it into the Wound, the Wick will ſwell in it, and the Tragacanth attracteth all the moiſt filth, which at one time with ſuch a Wick you may get out of the Wound The lint the Wick is made of muſt hang out of the Wound, to be pulled out thereby, elſe it may be loſt in the Wound. Uſe the Wicks ſo long, till the Wounds are cleanſed, and the heat and anger of it be paſt.</p>
                  <p>Some Surgeons uſe Camphire to cool the Wounds, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling <note place="margin">Camphire of no uſe here.</note> it with other things; but they do not well, becauſe Camphire is not of a cold quality, but of a penetrating heat. And that Camphire bringeth out heat and expels it, is not becauſe it is of a cooling property, but it comes from other cooling ſimples mingled with it. In this caſe Camphire is not to be uſed, for many reaſons, which to relate I forbear at this time; and chiefly in Wounds made by ſhot it is to be avoided, by reaſon of the affinity it hath with Saltpeters fire, known to Artiſts that deal therein.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Surgeons which uſe Gum Opium to their cooling Ointments, but as far as I know it is to little purpoſe. <note place="margin">Gummi Opium is nought here</note> Such Gum is not good to any Wound, for outwardly it cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Wound, within the Wound it burneth, unto which Experience beareth witneſs. Therefore it cannot quench any burning cauſed by Gun-powder; that thing quencheth ſuch a burning, which attracteth fire, as Saltpeter and Sulphur doth. Saltpeter and Sulphur keep their native quality ſtill, which is, to attract that fire which they have loſt, and quench that they ſet into fire. No more of this, and let every one defend what they uſe; I do not intend to gain-ſay that, which others have found good in their trials; for experimental knowledge is endleſs, and every day new things are brought to light, and they may be ſuch which I do not know of.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIV. </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Bone-fractures, and firſt of the naughty cuſtom which is kept in dreſſing them.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>To cure Bone-fractures is common, and known almoſt to all, it is of great conſequence that it be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for many know much, but have ſmall experience, and ſome want fundamental knowledge, who doubtleſs make many naughty cures, as Experience witneſſeth and whereas I have ſpoken in the firſt Part of many abuſes committed in general, ſo I thought good to ſpeak in particular of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are committed at the dreſſing of Fractures, and to give a warning to Novices in Surgery.</p>
                  <p>Touching the naughty uſe at the dreſſing of Wounds, <note place="margin">Abuſes at the dreſſing of Bone-fractures.</note> whereby Patients are neglected, which though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet it ſhall not ſtop me in the diſcloſing of it, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons quoted above, Know therefore, courteous Reader, that under this common uſe there lieth hid a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.</p>
                  <p>If a Fracture be ſet and placed right, after the ſetting they dreſs and bind it with ſplinters made purpoſely for that uſe, theſe are laid round about the Fracture, and with fitting fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and bands, on which there are ſmall eylid holes, through which the tapes are put, and ſo pulled together, and cloſed up, that it ſtir not. Before they do ſo, they uſually make a pap, called the drying band, of Tile ſtones, Bole, Walwort, and other ſuch like, as every one thinketh good, or hath ſeen others do it; this they apply about the Fracture, hoping with this Drier to reduce the Fracture to a ſpeedier heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is their common way, and hold it for a Maſter-piece.</p>
                  <p>As touching their Medicaments, I do not intend to diſanul them, and to make them of no effect; I ſhould not diſlike them ſo much if they had dealt well with the Bone-Fracture, The quoted manner of dreſſing I do not like at all, Firſt, by reaſon of the great pain cauſed thereby to the Patient,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106818:83"/> becauſe every Bone-fracture being ſet right, ſtriveth a little to a ſwelling, but the Fracture being thus incloſed and bound up, as you heard, how can it come to a ſwelling? (which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have:) Therefore ſhe preſſeth and ſtriveth the more, is made angry, and ſwelleth the more, and ſtill at the bands, where it finds any vent, there it forceth out the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which cannot be done without ſmarting pains to the party.</p>
                  <p>Yea, by this anger and forced ſwelling a whole Joynt and Member is ſuffocated, which can be proved by woful exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But this is little regarded of thoſe, who are ignorant of Nature and the true cauſe: and though it doth not happen alwayes, that a Fracture is choaked with ſuch dreſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it getteth vent ſometimes, yet that pain is ſo great, that all thoſe parts about the Fracture, be they ſinews, veins, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp;c. are ſo much angered, that the Patient is bereaved of his natural reſt, for in his ſleep he feels ſuch pulling in the bone, which awakeneth him with an amazement, theſe ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and amazements may eaſily cauſe other ſimptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Feavers, Inflammations, &amp;c. all which is cauſed by his unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and rude dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>All this is not enough yet, which enſueth upon ſuch rude dreſſing, there are other difficulties and inconveniences. For they dreſſing a Fracture in the quoted manner, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee nor know well, whether the broken ends are well ſet or no, for they think, if the ſplinters and boards lie well, then the bones alſo ſtand well together. They little think, that the parts of the broken bones either at the left or right ſide are terrified, and ſo the bone ſtands awry and crooked. This maketh them leave the Fracture undreſſed for ſome dayes, thinking as long as the ſplinters lie right, the bones alſo are in a right poſture, which muſt not be taken ill at their hands, becauſe they not knowing how to dreſs a Fracture well, it is no wonder, why they are ſo loath to undreſs it; but this is little eaſe to the Patient, which many times gets crooked legs and joynts, the one ſtanding outward, the other inward, which ſuch Surgeons little regard, be it ſtraight or crooked, as long as they have made a cure.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106818:84"/>
                  <p> This before named manner of dreſſing is old, and hath been practiſed many years, and ſo men muſt beleive that it is good, becauſe it is antient.</p>
                  <p>I will ſay nothing of that which is ſtill in uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Screw-box (which hath been a long time in practiſe) not regarding the great danger and hurt which they cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as daily experience witneſſeth, but poor Patients have ſmall cauſe to rejoyce at this. This box uſually openeth with wings, which ſome uſe for Fractures: I partly commend it, but never made uſe of it, becauſe my Band is eaſie, and the band with the Leg may eaſily be lifted, and thereby the whole Member I may eaſily lift which way I pleaſe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feared to ſtir the Fracture, becauſe no ſplinter nor band is made looſe. And when I intended to open it; then I pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Leg even and plain as I thought it was fitteſt, and then I laid it down and undid the ſplinters, which I was to take off by reaſon of the Wound, which was to be cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpeak here of thoſe, which think themſelves wiſe and ſubtiler, and make uſe of Wheel-chips, or ſuch boards that are uſed for ſheaths: ſuch things indeed are of no great conſequence, neither doth it matter much, whether the one uſe Walwort, the other broken ſtones, and a third uſe another thing, and every ones cookery differs according to their skill.</p>
                  <p>To cure a Fracture in it ſelf, underſtand me right, is no great skill, becauſe every broken bone eaſily and willingly inclineth to healing, but the Manual is all in all, how to deal well with a broken Leg or Arm, and to keep it in a due fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and poſture; of all which I will give you a full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Reader, I would have you ponder it, and not be eaſily miſled, neither to think the worſe of the ſlightneſs of my dreſſing of Bone-fractures and broken Ligaments. Be aſſured, that ſuch manner of dreſſing, which I will ſhew you, cauſeth leſs pains, and is more eaſily done than the other way named before, though generally uſed among Surgeons, eſpecially touching the ſwelling, as you heard before, and you ſhall hear more of it.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:106818:84"/>
                  <p> For many reaſons known to me, I will not ſpeak much of here, how a Fracture is to be cured and healed, without the uſe of any ſplinters, onely the Fracture muſt be carefully and rightly ſet, and kept quiet in a good reſt; ſome Surgeons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to practiſe that way, and have good ſucceſs therein: But being it requireth great carefulneſs, therefore that way plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not every Surgeon. That manner of binding and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which I will ſet down, I hold it to be the beſt, as being the ſafeſt way, accompanied with leſs peril, cauſing fewer pains and little ſwelling, even as if the Fracture were not bound at all.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A fundamental Inſtruction of the true Cure of broken Bones, how Surgeons ought to be regulated in the dreſſing of them, and how to keep the Fracture from up-ſwelling and from pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN broken bones it uſually happeneth, that either the skin <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Fractures.</note> or the fleſh is broken, or both theſe be whole, and onely the bone is broken; this difference I ſpeak of by reaſon of an open Wound; their cure is of no great difference: I will ſet my Cures one way for the moſt, hoping the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader will be regulated after my inſtruction, in other Fractures, of which I ſhall not altogether be ſilent.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place it is moſt neceſſary, if a Surgeon hath a <note place="margin">To know the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments.</note> Fracture in cure, that he diſcern Mans inward condition, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the Ligaments, for theſe differ very much, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there lie two together, ſometimes one, and one is crooked, and the other is ſtraight. Anatomy School teacheth largely of it, and thither I direct you.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon being made ready, and having all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <note place="margin">To be ready for all things.</note> in caſe he be to dreſs a Patient in haſt, for delayes breeds no good in Surgery, eſpecially at the dreſſing of Wounds. Let him have in readineſs a bundle of pine-wood ſplinters of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106818:85"/> all ſorts, to fit the Fractures above and beneath; of a pretty ſtrength, broad and ſmall ones, crooked and ſtraight ones, and to have a ſtore of all ſorts of boards and ſplinters, and let him ſplit them with a Wood-mans Axe or Hook, and cut them hollow, ſome muſt be hollower than others, ſome muſt be ſmall, ſome broad, ſome ſhort and ſome long, according as the wood will bear it, the one crooked, the other ſtraight, the one thick, the other thin, ſome ſtrong ones, ſome weak ones, of an arms or fingers length, as the wood will cleave in length, ſome crooked, others crookeder, Briefly, you muſt have all ſorts, and ſuch alſo which you think are of no uſe, theſe may fit beſt of all, ſometimes I choſe the moſt crooked and worſt of them, which Wood-men intended for fewel, and ſplitted them, which came out hollowed ſtrangely, and were beſt for my uſe, into which I placed a Knee, or Ankle, or Elbow, a Hand or other crooked Member; and as Men differ in their Ankles and Joynts, ſo theſe ſplinters muſt not be of one ſort, therefore I ſought and meaſured ſo long, till my deſire was ſatisfied. The ſplinters muſt be meaſured firſt before you ſtretched and ſet the bone, elſe it would fall too long, both for the Patient and thoſe that bear him up, and the Fracture may be ſtirred, and that which you ſet together might eaſily with one gripe be unſet, which would prove ill and painful to the Patient, and cauſe a greater ſwelling. It would be a groſs fault, if you ſhould not firſt meaſure the ſplinters, before you touch the Patient to dreſs him: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordered the ſplinters, then ſpread ſome plaiſter-ſalve on them, that in their application they may ſtick the cloſer; and do not ſpread too much on them, elſe in the dreſſing they would be ſtirred, and though you think the ſplinters are well applied, yet will they ſtir when pulled and laced together. Lay the ſplinters a fingers breadth aſunder when you apply them about the Fracture, becauſe they come cloſer at their lacing and binding. Therefore lay them not too cloſe, elſe at the pulling they will go one over the other, and too many ſplinters are more hurtful than two few. In brief, there was no wood ſo crooked, but I made crooked ſplinters of it, and the bigger the billet was the better I liked it, and the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106818:85"/> will fall more hollowed. Therefore the greater and crookeder the wood is, the better the great ones for grown people, and the ſmaller will ſerve for children, I had long ſplinters reaching from the foot to the hip for unruly Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, they will make them lie ſtill. And if a Surgeon dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch Fractures, and he hath a thouſand of ſuch ſplinters in ſtore, <hi>viz</hi> great, ſmall, crooked, ſtraight, hollow, plain, weak, ſtrong, narrow, broad and broader ones, let the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be as they will, they will be for ſome uſe, and your ſtore will be no ſore unto you, for I had uſe for ſome, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought they would be ſerviceable; practiſe made me to get ſuch a ſtore. Therefore provide good ſtore of them, and if ſome do not fit, you may make them fit for your uſe, as the ſeveral Fractures may require. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> though you may think they will fit, yet they want much of that, be it in their length, breadth, ſmalneſs, narrowneſs, ſtraightneſs, or crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which you cannot know before you tried it; he that weareth the ſhooes knoweth where they wring. Begrudge not your labour you beſtow on the cutting, meaſuring and applying of ſplinters, for it is one of the chiefeſt Manuals, to lay ſplinters aright, and to ſet them well together, for if you miſs in the due placing of ſplinters, you may miſs in the whole cure.</p>
                  <p>Many have on their ſplinters laces and loops, I do not contemn theſe, for many honeſt Surgeons made uſe of ſuch, and do ſtill, and have had good ſucceſs with them. But I never uſed them, becauſe I had good ſtore of ſplinters, and uſed ſuch hollowed ſplinters without lacing, applied them looſe on the plaiſter, and pulled them together with two or three bindings, commonly I uſed to it ſome pieces of fuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cutting them of two fingers breadth, and ſomewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, that a knot could be made with them, and to the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt I made the firſt knot, then I could ſee how it would fit, whether there be too many of the ſplinters or two few, and placed them as I ſaw it fitting, then I laid the uppermoſt band, where I could ſee the better, whether it would be too much or too little, that knot I pulled hard together, becauſe it will ſtill yeild and ſlacken, at laſt I laid the lowermoſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106818:86"/> band, then commonly the middlemoſt was tied too ſlack, which I opened and pulled it as hard as I thought it would hold the Fracture without hurting the Joynt, and the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be kept from ſtirring. Theſe three bands hold the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and if dreſſed and bound otherwiſe it doth no good. Thus much of ſplinters.</p>
                  <p>A Surgeon ought to have two roulers, or at leaſt one, <note place="margin">Of the Roulers.</note> though there be no need of them, yet they muſt be had in ſtore, and great pieces of ſpread plaiſters, ſeven or eight, and a number of all ſorts of ſplinters, ſhort, long, crooked and plain ones, for to flap-Wounds you muſt have ſeveral ſorts, according as they are made.</p>
                  <p>Roulers muſt be made not too broad, and muſt run with the threed or Wool, and cut with the threed, or tear them after the threed, which is beſt, and cut off the ravelings, for ſome of them have hindered me much; in the ſame manner you muſt cut even the plaiſters and the ſplinters all the ſides along, for the ſmoother and plainer a thing is, the better is it handled, nor let the linnen be wrinkled or plated, nor the plaiſters neither, and apply them plain and ſmooth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the plaiſters ſtraight, for they will ſlacken faſt enough when the ſplinters are pulled together; wet your finger ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Water, or with a little of the Ointment, then the Plaiſter will not cling to your finger.</p>
                  <p>Then have a long Rouler at hand, with two other ordinary Roulers, as alſo five ſmal pieces cut from one end of the piece to the other; and have your Surgeons box filled with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> Raiſor, Spatule, Sheers, keep the box clean, that you may in nothing be hindered; have in readineſs alſo a good piece of plaiſter in a box of Tin or Copper, which being hard, you may fling it into hot Water to ſoften it.</p>
                  <p>Have a good Knife alſo about you, in caſe you have need to cut the ſplinters to a fitneſs; alſo a Sponge, and a threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Needle, and a piece of lint. Beſides the great Plaiſter (which muſt be ſpread broad and thick) you muſt have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmaller pieces, whereby you may fill up places if need. Therefore ſpread alwayes more Plaiſters than you think you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106818:86"/> ſhall have uſe for. <hi>Item.</hi> Be provided with Stitch-plaiſters, bolſters or bags filled with chaffe. Provide alſo Fracture plaiſters, of the which hereafter is ſpoken, and ſpread it on a ſtrong cloath, broad and long, according to the bigneſs of the Fracture: and you muſt be provided alſo with ordinary Plaiſters, made of two parts of Wax, one part of Turpentine, and one part of Suet, and ſpread them thick and broad, as the firſt Plaiſters are: laſtly, you muſt have in readineſs alſo broad linnen, as you ſhall hear: all theſe things named are neceſſary for to dreſs a Fracture.</p>
                  <p>The above-mentioned Fracture-plaiſters make thus: <note place="margin">How to make Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note>

For this Reſine draweth forth the ſuperfluous moiſture which the bones caſt up, and coagulateth the on-growing the ſooner, and maketh it come together, and then the ſaid Hearb <hi>Barbahirci</hi> is an extraordinary healer far beyond other Wound-hearbs: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Comfrey, Walwort, Sanicle, Biſtorta, have their vertues alſo in the joyning the bones together, but not comparable to this Reſine; true, they draw forth the filth from fleſh and bloud, but to get out the matter out of the bones, they are not ſtrong enough, much leſs is <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> and <hi>Bolus,</hi> of that vertue: true, all theſe are great driers, but have no power to extract things that lie deep. <note place="margin">To heal with greaſie things is nought.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will ſay nothing here of thoſe, which uſe to broken bones ſeveral fat and greaſie things, there is no reaſon to defend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106818:87"/> what they do, whoſe actions I reject as nought for many reaſons; Oyls, Waters, Lies, &amp;c. are not to be uſed. For no man that is ſwelled ought to be wetted, drying things are good for him; I diſſwade here the uſe of Oyls and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though they be more pleaſant to Mans body than Lies or Waters.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the handling of the Fracture, I will firſt inform the courteous Reader, how many ſorts of Fractures there may happen unto Mans body, then will I ſpeak of them in particular, where you ſhall faithfully be informed in things that I have found in my practiſe, to the good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of poor Patients and Surgeons.</p>
                  <p>It happeneth many times, that the foremoſt part of the Arms bones are broken, ſometimes the uppermoſt great bone or Shin, and ſometimes the leſſer bone, and ſometimes both theſe are broken, and ſometimes the upper part of the Shin hath a Sciſſure, and ſometimes the Arm or Hand is bowed or diſlocated, and may be ſet right again, even as a ſtick bowed may be made ſtraight; ſometime their Fracture breaks through the skin, at the end of it, and are apparent to the eye. In brief, there are ſeveral ſorts of Fractures in theſe places, all which are known by the practiſe; as that part above the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and thoſe below the Knee, and who can remember all ſuch accidents? ſometimes a bone in the Finger is broken, and another in the Shoulder, or the Shoulder blade, or the Neck bone, or a Toe, or the Knee-pan, which ſometime is ſplit and broken. I have had Patients, whoſe Knee-pan was thorough cloven; ſometimes the Elbows-knockle is broken, ſometimes the gibbous part of the Hip, as it befell mine own Child, and grew halting of it; ſometimes the Ankles is off from the bone, ſometimes the bone of the Foots wriſt is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or that upon the Hand, and ſometimes the bones go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, or raiſe, yet are unbroken, ſometimes the Skull is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the bones and criſſels of the Noſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient hath a bowed Arm or Bone, then feel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be broken, and look well in what place it is ſo, for ſometimes a Bone is bowed without a Fracture, which by the hard feeling you may learn whether it be a Fracture or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106818:87"/> no; if none, then ſet it right again, even as a haſel ſtick may be made ſtraight if bowed; then lay a four-doubled Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to that raiſed part, and lay ſplinters to the hollow ſide, two ſplinters will ſerve the turn, one to the raiſed part, and the other to the hollow part, uſe not many Roulers, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pull it hard, it will not ſtir, if once you placed the ſplinters right.</p>
                  <p>There is more difficulty to heal a broken bone on the Leg, then one on the Arm, and the former requireth more time in healing, and ſtronger bands; and a Fracture above the Knee is of a worſe healing than that below it, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is to the Knee above, the worſe it is; if the Fracture be on the Shin, it is eaſier healed, than if it were near the Joynt; a Fracture near the Hip is hardly cured; a Fracture near the Knockles is worſe than that in the middle. In brief, the higher it is on the bone, the worſe it is, and the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it is to the joynt, the worſe it is to be cured. Of all this you ought to take notice, and deal more carefully with the Leg than with the Arm, for you may think the Leg is cured, and the Patient may run away with it, when he may ſcarce halt on it, here and there ſome defects may be, and his Leg may ſwell and his Foot alſo, or may wither and dry away, therefore have a care, and keep him under your cure for ſome weeks.</p>
                  <p>If a Leg be broken either above or below the Knee, dreſs <note place="margin">Where a Fracture ought to be dreſſed.</note> it not at home in your houſe, nor in any ſtrange houſe, unleſs the Patient be reſolved to ſtay there, for if after dreſſing he ſhould be removed, the bands would not hold as well as when he lieth ſtill. Therefore preſume not to dreſs a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in a ſtrange place, whence the Patient muſt be removed preſently after he be dreſt; the Fracture on a Leg is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition then that in the Arm or Shoulder: a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture on an Arm may be dreſt in ſtrange places, for the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent may then more ſafely be removed after dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>The Patient being reſolved to ſtay in a place, then place him ſo, that the Fracture come to lie forward, and in caſe you cannot do ſo, then do it thus, that you may come at both ſides to the Leg, which is more convenient, you may ask the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106818:88"/> Patient which way he would lie; at firſt let him not lie too low, for in time he will be low enough; let him lie high at the head, let his bed be ſomewhat hard, for in a ſoft bed he lieth too deep, and you muſt not ſhift him from his firſt lying in eight dayes.</p>
                  <p>For the longer the firſt dreſſing lieth on, the better it is; the greateſt error is here committed, to let the Patient riſe too ſoon, or to ſhift him, when once well laid and dreſt, for if the Fracture be ſtirred but in the leaſt manner, than the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is extreamly hindered thereby.</p>
                  <p>Having well laid your Patient, be it Man or Woman, young or old, let him lie onely in his ſhirt, and in no other clothes, and place his bed ſo, that you may come conveniently near him with your right hand, your ſpread Plaiſters and other neceſſaries muſt be laid on a ſtool to your right hand, and te hollow ſide of the ſplinters muſt be ſpread alſo with ſalves, that being applied to the Plaiſter, they may ſtick and hold the better, and ſuch things, which you do not uſe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, lay aſide, that they may not hinder you, eſpecially ſuch ſplinters which you do not uſe then, that the other which are fitted may the more uptly be applied.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Perſons that are preſent, you muſt have one to reach things unto you which you have need of; and there <note place="margin">What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to be preſent at the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> muſt alſo be two ſtrong men, which are ſound and hardy, to hold the Patient unmoveably below and above; there muſt be alſo another man or woman to ſpeak comfortably to the Patient, and in caſe he faint, to refreſh him with ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; and there muſt be one more, which holds the Patients other leg, for fear he ſhould interrupt you in your dreſſing; if any more perſons are preſent, let them ſtand off, and let none come near, unleſs you bid him to fetch or reach ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you. Being thus well provided with all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then take a Baſon full of cold water, with a ſponge in it, and ſet that by you, that in caſe the Plaiſters roul or fold together, that you may open them again with your wet hand. <note place="margin">The Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons poſture at the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now touching your ſelf; pull off your doublet, thruſt up your ſleeves, be bare-headed, have ſome cloth near ye, to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106818:88"/> dry your hands withal and other things, for it is fitting to have clean hands; if the Fracture be above the Knee, then give a ſtrong ſwadling-band into his hand, which holds the Patients upper part of the thigh, let the Patient put it through the thigh, and hold it by the two ends, or another that ſtands by may hold it; for whether the bone be quite off, or not, it muſt be more ſtrongly pulled to, then when it is but contuſed or cruſhed, therefore the ſwadling-band muſt be put through the Leg which is broken, that the one or other hold it faſt, &amp; if one grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th weary in holding, another may take it &amp; ſo to keep the Leg from ſinking; he that holds the ſwadling-band muſt ſtand to that ſide of the Patient where the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is; and he that holdeth the neather part of the Leg, muſt ſtand on that ſide which is ſound; and the next man, which holdeth neither cloth, ſwadle nor leg, but is to help you to joyn the Fracture, let him lay one hand to the Patients muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and let him lay the other hand below the Fracture, and extend the Patients skin, and with both hands keep it aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the skin be ſpanned aſunder; &amp; above they muſt hold ſtrongly alſo with ſpann'd hands, and let one hold alſo high on the thigh, that you may not be hindered when you apply the Plaiſters, ſplinters, &amp;c. let the Patient not lie in the midſt of the bed, but near the ſide of it, where he is dreſſed, that thoſe which hold him may do it with more eaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Patient muſt not lie too high with his head whilſt he is dreſſing, but ſomewhat lower than ordinary till he be dreſt, then do as you pleaſe, but ſtir not his body. He that holdeth the Leg below, muſt ſtand thus, as if he ſtood between the Patients Legs, and that at the beds feet, and not at the ſide, unleſs it could not be otherwiſe. He muſt have alſo a ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-band, to lay it ſingly about the Patients broken bone, no higher than to the Knees, that the plaiſters and ſplinters may the plainer be applied. But in caſe the Fracture be next to the Knee from below, then uſe no ſwadlings over the Knee, it would fal obſtructive to the dreſſing. In caſe the broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ones cannot be ſet or well joyned together, then there muſt be uſed another help; one muſt lay one hand above the Knee, and the other below it, and turn in the ſwadlings a little, thus
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106818:89"/> will he be able to hold out the longer; this ſwadling-band is the fitter to hold by, then to hold with the naked hands, which if they ſweat will not hold ſo faſt.</p>
                  <p>Let the bone neither be lifted nor ſtretched, unleſs you be <note place="margin">The broken Leg not to be lifted or ſtretched, unleſs the Surgeon be ready with all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</note> ready with all your neceſſaries about ye; let threed and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not be wanting, the ſponge be ſufficiently wrung, many little pieces of plaiſters be ready cut, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer, as paper Roſes are uſually cut, &amp; the ſplinters inſide be ready ſpread, and ſome pieces of ſalve of a beans bigneſs be laid by you, that if one ſplinter do not ſtick and cling, you may ſpread on it ſuch a piece of the ſalve, for ſplinters will not alwayes hold near the hip, where the place is thickeſt, there the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt be ſpread moſt, then the applied linnen will hold the better. Two or three plaiſters more you muſt have, of a fingers breadth, and of a ſpans length, in caſe two or three ſplinters were to be joyned together, that with theſe plaiſters they may be kept together; and if theſe plaiſters be cut with the threed, then they hold as firm as a ſtitch-plaiſter, and muſt be laid the croſs way on the ſplinters; order thus three or four of them in the middle of the Leg by the Fracture. He that holds the Patient, either his ſound Arm or Leg, and is to comfort him, muſt not be on that ſide where the Fracture is: and he that reacheth things to you, muſt ſtand behind you on the right ſide, and not too nigh, as to touch ye.</p>
                  <p>Having all things in readineſs, then in Gods Name bid him that holdeth the Leg below, to lift it up, and you lay your left hand under or beneath the Fracture and lift up, and he that ſtandeth at the upper place muſt help alſo to lift, and lay him in a poſture.</p>
                  <p>Annoint your hands with <hi>Dialthoea,</hi> and feel about the Fracture, to know what condition it be of, whether it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">To feel the Fracture.</note> outward or inward, up or downward, whether the upper bone which goeth to the Hip; ſometimes it fals at the ſide upward, but ſeldom: be cautious in the feeling, and ſtretch it out without interruption, till you ſee it is enough out-ſtretched, and then with your hands ſet the bones together as well as you can, ſet it ſo, that no unevenneſs be ſeen, no hole, no bile, no bowing; feel with your hands to and fro,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106818:89"/> up and down, and on both ſides, and try every where, whether you can feel any unevenneſs, whatever you find uneven, leave is not ſo, but preſs it in or outward, or up or downward, even as the ſtaves of a tub are ſet right, which were bowed in or outward; for if theſe uneven things are not made even with preſſing they will not hold ſo well, they muſt directly be ſet even one upon another, therefore give not over, unleſs your be ſure they ſtand one upon another; let another alſo feel and touch after you, who in your abſence may bear witneſs, that you left not the Patient before the bones were well ſet together. For ſuch Fractures are more difficult to be ſet one upon another, which are ſhort broken off, then thoſe which are onely ſhattered, for there is leſs toil to bring ſuch ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters together, and to keep them together, then the other, which are ſhort broken off: for things broken in ſplinters willingly keep together as they are ſet, and contuſed bones are eaſier healed than bones ſhort broken: and in caſe you cannot well preſs in theſe bones, then is it a ſign, that ſome ſplinters or other branches are in the way; if ſo, then you muſt regulate your ſelf with the reſt with preſſings, heavings and turnings: bid him that ſtands below to turn his hands, either out or inward, as occaſion requireth, and ſee whether you may find the true places for ſuch branches, and to ſet them into their due places. In caſe this will not do well, then bid the lowermoſt man to bow his hands downwards, and do as if you would bow his bone, then you will ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will hang on, and then ſeek for its due place, unto which the branch belongeth.</p>
                  <p>But if a bone be contuſed, ſo that it will fall ſhort, then let it be well out-ſtretched, then ball the bones together with your hands, as a ſnow-ball is made, and preſs it hard, as you think good; this is eaſier done then to ſet right a bone which is ſhort broke off, and keepeth better unſtirred in the band then the foreſaid Fracture, and a Contuſion healeth more firmly and ſtrongly then a ſhort off-cut Fracture, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſeth a halting, conſumption and exiccation of the Wound, a Contuſion doth it not ſo much; if that Fracture be ſucceſsfully well ſet in its due place, then take not too haſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:106818:90"/> away your hand from the Fracture, keep your hand or thumb on the place inward, that the Fracture may not go out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and thoſe who hold the Patient may in the mean while recover themſelves in their wearineſs.</p>
                  <p>Then take a broad ſhort ſplinter, which is fitted well for the place, lay it firſt upon the plaiſter, where it is not ſpread, for the plaiſter muſt be laid double, plainly extended, without any wrinkle, the plaiſter muſt not wholly cloſe the bone, but muſt ſtand aſunder two ſtraws breadth, or half a fingers breadth, elſe it would ſtick ſo cloſe to the bone, together with the ſplinters, that you can hardly get it off without danger; for my ſelf had many times more toil with the ſecond dreſſing then I had with the firſt, becauſe it ſtuck ſo cloſe to the skin, eſpecially if any hair were grown on the Fracture, and it were fit that the hair thereabout be firſt ſhaven away. Now having applied thus the plaiſter then lay the undermoſt ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter next to it, the Patient may the eaſier be lifted with the help of the other two men, which will have enough to do to hold him faſt, before he be fitted in his poſture. That ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being laid, then lay alſo the uppermoſt ſplinter, ſhort and broad, and tie them both together with one band, then you ſee how far aſunder you are to lay the reſt, for theſe ſplinters will creep cloſer together then you may imagine; then lay the broadeſt ſplinter upon the Fracture, and before you lay it, lay firſt the plaiſters made Roſe like, directly upon the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, to the place where the Fracture came out at firſt, to keep it in, then lay a thick bolſter upon, and the Roſe like Plaiſter will be kept together by the broad ſplinter, and muſt not be laid too thick one upon another, elſe they would pinch the Patient too much, and growing hard there, would print a hole into the fleſh, which would be a hinderance unto the healing: You muſt keep open one part of the plaiſter, that it may be taken off, for it will not come off eaſily: The open par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the plaiſter muſt not be juſt upon the Fracture, nor below it, but at the ſide, and there muſt no ſplinter come to lie on that ſtreak, but it muſt be betwixt the two ſplinters, and the bands muſt be well pulled together for all that, ſo hard, as if the plaiſters were laid one over another; and when you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106818:90"/> have laid that plaiſter Roſe upon the place where the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture came out, then make looſe the two bands, where the two ſplinters were bound together, above and below, to ſee how it will fit beſt, and let theſe two ſplinters lie ſtill, and then lay the reſt of the ſplinters as you pleaſe; for the two ſplinters which lie at the ſide of the Knee muſt reach more than a hands breadth below the Knee, then you may tie them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch long ones will hold ſtrongly; the four broad ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt be ordered, as you heard above, muſt lie cloſe as if they were grown on it, the one under, the other above, two at the ſides, and then ſometimes two little ſplinters betwixt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bigneſs of the Patients Limbs you muſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your ſelf with your ſplinters. Look well, that the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be longer and broader than the ſplinters, for if the ſplinters be longer they pinch the Patient; if ſo, then he muſt endure it till he be undreſt again, which will not be before ten dayes be paſt. You muſt alſo lay ſome ſmall cut pieces of plaiſter to ſuch places, where you cannot come to with the great plaiſter, which are of a ſpans breadth, and of two ſpans length, and thus they fit beſt; where the length or breadth of the plaiſter doth not reach unto, to that ſpace others muſt be laid, and ſo you muſt do with the ſmall pieces, in caſe the great ones do not fit. At the dreſſing note, bind the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt band firſt about, pull it well together, that the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lie on cloſe, then bind the uppermoſt band by the Hip, and tie it faſt that it yeild not, and the ſmall bands you ſtitch or faſten with a Stitch plaiſter; then bind the middlemoſt band above the Knee.</p>
                  <p>That which hitherto hath been ſpoken of bands, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus: lay two or three bands in the bed under the Patients Fracture, that when you intend to tie them cloſer together, then you need not to lift his Leg to thruſt the bands under it; therefore lay all the bands you have need of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Leg, and the garters alſo, all this muſt be done before the Leg be laid down. If the middlemoſt band be tied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too hard, then ſlacken it a little, but if you think it is well, then let <note place="margin">How the Leg is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after dreſſing.</note> it alone, then tie the other bands alſo, as you think it fit; if one be tied too ſlack, then pull it cloſer, and ſet his great Toe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106818:91"/> upright, and let not his Foot or Leg fall on a ſide, and ſuffer not the great Toe to hang outward, for if the Foot lieth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally outward, and is ſo healed, it will never be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again, but if the great Toe be turned inwards, then that may be holp again in good time.</p>
                  <p>The contrary is obſerved at the healing of an Arm, for if <note place="margin">How to place a hand or foot.</note> you uſe the Thumb inwards to lie, you will hardly turn it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again, therefore the Thumb muſt be turned outwards when you lay the Arm into the band. The bones muſt be ſet together as they were at firſt, then they may moſt ſafely be healed in the beſt way as may be done.</p>
                  <p>At the healing of a Fracture on the Leg, the Foot muſt be turned more inward than outward, but the beſt way is to ſet the Foot upright; this I ſpeak to that end, that you ſhould be the more careful, not to place the Leg or Foot outward, neither muſt the Hand be bent inward, theſe are contrary wayes healed; the Hand muſt be laid ſo, that the Patient may behold the inſide of his Hand, and not ſo, as that he may look onely on the Thumbs outſide, for a Hand is hardly turned again if it be healed in an upright poſture. Therefore I reject the ſplinters made for the Arm, which <note place="margin">Why the Arm box is rejected.</note> were ſpoken of above, becauſe they keep down the Hand in a flat way, thereby the broken bones are hindered, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſet or kept even one upon another, which by the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reaſons is proved ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Touching the upper part of the Arm, there the danger is not ſo great, becauſe there is but one bone there; and what is ſpoken here of this part of the Arm, the ſame muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood alſo of ſuch bones that are of the like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt note, that the uppermoſt part of the bone <note place="margin">How to deal with the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt bones.</note> muſt more carefully be ſet than that in the Arm below the Elbow, and cannot ſo eaſily be kept even together. And thoſe are much miſtaken, who ſuppoſe, that when the Knee lieth upright all things are well, which is found falſe in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and is clean contrary: If ſuch a party is dreſt, then lay him on a ſack in form of a cuſhion, which muſt be of an ells length or longer, according to the Patients bigneſs, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106818:91"/> muſt be of an ells length, or longer, according to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents bigneſs, which muſt be filled with chaffe or ſtraw cut ſmall, it muſt not be filled too full, leave it hollow in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and lay his Foot or Knee into, lay ſome ſtraw for his Heel to reſt upon, his Heel muſt lie deeper than his Knee, then the ſtraw raiſeth by the Foot or Knee, which then lieth as a ſtick unmoveable, and the neather part of the Leg muſt lie higher, that is, the Foot on the ſack muſt lie higher than the Leg, and the Shin muſt lie higher than the Knee, and the Knee muſt lie higher than the uppermoſt of the Thigh. You muſt have a care alſo, that when you let him lie ſo for ſome dayes, and he doth not ſtir his Knee, you muſt look in the whole to the laſt, that his Knee do not remain thus, which will hardly be bowed afterward without paining of him, and ſo it may fall out, that if he be healed in few dayes, then you will have much to do with the Knee before you will be able to bend it. <hi>Item.</hi> You muſt have a care of the Arms, Elbows, Knockles in the Hands, and the Ankles in the Feet. This ſtirring and bending at the Knee muſt be after the ſecond dreſſing, at the firſt it is needleſs.</p>
                  <p>This is the beſt and plaineſt way of dreſſing of Fractures, <note place="margin">The conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the dreſſing</note> and you may look every day to the band ſeveral times, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the plaiſter muſt not be taken off, and the Patient, as he pleaſeth, may add to, or take from theſe three bands, and may do it ſafely without any peril, and ſuch a Patient may with more convenience be carried into the Country, being dreſt in this manner, then if he were dreſt after the common way; for this band is light and plain, and doth not burthen the Fracture at all; and in caſe the bones Fracture would be in a ſwelling, it may do it conveniently without cauſing any anger; and that ſwelling being upon ſettling, then the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, bone and skin ſettleth alſo, drawing and clinging much unto it, and thereby the bones are kept and forced to ſtand ſtiffely together.</p>
                  <p>Other ordinary bands, which are applied round about the <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the other bands.</note> broken Member, cannot effect the ſame. For as ſoon as there any ſwelling appeareth, then are the bands ſtirred and raiſed, and Nature not enduring to be tied up, there is ſoon an anger
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106818:92"/> cauſed thereby, which ſurely will afford enough of ſmarting pains. For it is often ſeen, that ſuch forced ſwellings preſs forth betwixt the bands and the ſplinters, whereby that Joint or Member is ſuffocated; and in caſe theſe miſcheives ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not, yet is this incommodity ſubſequent, that the bands, which lie about the Fracture, and have quite encompaſſed the Member, are ſo ſtrongly extended, that when the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are upon ſettling, and the Joynt or Member begins to leſſen, that the band groweth looſe and ſlack about the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the foreſaid ſwelling and anger having brought ſome humour into the Member, cauſeth the Fracture to yeild to the ſide, and the healing of it proveth uneven. Hence is it, why ſo many halting and crooked Joynts about men are ſeen. <note place="margin">The cauſe of ſhort and bowed Members.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have never annointed any Fracture, becauſe I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that thereby the Fractures would be healed ſoft, therefore I ſtill applied the plaiſter to it, and never uſed any <note place="margin">Why Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ought not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</note> Ointment, and dreſt the Patient but ſeldom, for I was afraid, that at the dreſſings I might ſtir the Fracture. Therefore if the Patient at the firſt time be well dreſt, let him keep that band for a time; but in caſe the Patient complaineth that his Foot and Toe is ſwelled, and is painful unto him, then look where the fault lieth, and let him not lie long in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily know where the fault lieth, if you undo the bands, and the Fracture hath vent, if then the pain cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <note place="margin">To know the errors committed in the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> then the ſplinters were in fault, which pinched the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or elſe he was pained in another place. In caſe after this opening the Patient feels ſtill ſome pains, then is it a ſure ſign, that ſomething is ſtirred in the Fracture, be it as much as it will; the place where the fault is committed you may learn of the pains; for when you touch the Fracture on that place where the pain is, on that ſide the neathermoſt part of the bone is ſtirred and turned, either up or downwards, or to the ſide; if you find it thus, delay no time, undo the Fracture, and bring to right the diſordered part, and then dreſs it in the former manner, and is done quickly. Some Fractures may not be ordered in many dayes.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:106818:92"/>
                  <p> This was alwayes to me a ſure Sign, whereby I knew whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſtood well or no with the Fracture, and whether it was bound too hard or too ſlack.</p>

                     <p>Preſume not to dreſs any Fracture before you be provided with all neceſſaries, as you heard above; let there be no want of ſplinters, roulers, linnen clothes, plaiſters, and be ſure you want none of ſuch like things: be not to ſeek ſuch that hold the Patient, or that help to lift him, for men at the beginning may be luſty and ſtrong, but in time theſe growing weary, looking for freſh ones, one danger or other will be cauſed, and in caſe you be not provided ſufficiently with plaiſters and ſplinters, what time can you have to ſpread and to ſplit more of them? for when once you begin to preſs and to ſet the Fracture, how can you get off or hold up the Fracture, without hurt and pains to the Patient?</p>
                     <p>The Fracture, where it is broken muſt be ſupplied thick with plaiſters, eſpecially that place where the bone came forth, and apply ſmall pieces of plaiſters cloſe and thick, and keep in the Fracture by force, that it may not come forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for it eaſily comes out by that firſt place, and the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo muſt be bound hard to it.</p>
                     <p>Splinters muſt not be cut too ſhort, which would pinch the Patient; neither muſt you apply any ſplinter to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked skin, elſe they are burning and pinching the Patient too much.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving ſufficiently and largely ſpoken of ordinary Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and Contuſions, now it follows, that I ſpeak ſome remarkable things about Flap-fractures, and will declare it faithfully, as much as I have ſeen in my practiſe, and as much as Novices in Surgery ought to know,</p>
                  <p>I call this a Flap-fracture, when the Wound of the broken Leg goeth onely through the fleſh and skin, and cometh forth with the one end.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the healing of theſe Fractures; in the firſt place note, that this cure requireth a more exact carefulneſs than the former Fractures I told you of. For a Flap fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture feſtereth, even as any other wounded Member, becauſe theſe muſt be dreſt twice or thrice in a day, for there cometh ſo much corruption into it, that it runneth through the band and skin, and can hardly be ſtayed. And in that corruption are bred many times living Worms, and that more in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than Winters ſeaſon, and ſooner in a hot than in a cold Climate, and in ſome Patients ſooner than in others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are forced to dreſs them oftner than you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, becauſe there is a neceſſity for it; for frequent dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are hurtful to Fractures; and ſuch Fractures are very dangerous, where the great bones are wounded, and ſome bones and ligaments gone from them, then is there great danger at hand: Theſe I have been ſeveral times at, where the perſons preſent did wonder, and were amazed, how ſuch Wounds and Fractures could be dreſſed, when ſo many wounds and holes are in one Wound, and filled up with filth abundantly! My ſelf marvelled many times, how it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that one or the other in ſuch ſimptoms could have their food, and how life could remain in the Leg; however God gave his bleſſing thereunto, that many ſuch Patients recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their going and jumping, and could perform all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106818:94"/> of work. You remember, that I warned you before not to cut off any thing from a wounded Member which hangeth down, and I give you further warning, not to bereave any Member, though there be never ſo little hopes for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, for Gods bleſſing may be great upon it, beyond all mens expectation. And in caſe any ſuch is brought unto you, or you are called unto them, then view the Wound very well, and touch it but a little, neither lift him, nor lay him down, that you may cauſe no pains unto him, and terrifie him not at the firſt, for if you amaze the Patient at firſt, you make him unwilling to let you touch him. Secondly, look that you ſtench the bloud preſently, before you make ready your things, then the dreſſing of him will fall the eaſier; the bloud unſtenched will not ſuffer you to dreſs him: make the Wound clean with a ſponge, and let it be dry, then you may ſee what it is, and what defect there is therein: you need to this bloud-ſtenching onely a ſponge and lint, Cotten Wooll, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Note, that ordinary Fractures do not bleed ſo much as theſe thorough broken Flap-fractures, therefore in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular you muſt have a care to ſtench its bleeding: for my part I have had troubles enough with them: Cleanſe the Wound well round about, that Worms and Magots do not engender there. And let the Patient eat ſomewhat whilſt you are cleanſing his Wound. Bid thoſe that are preſent to bring forth all neceſſaries which you are to uſe about him, <hi>viz.</hi> the bed, cuſhions, pillows, ſwadling-bands, towels to ſet him upright withal, for with ſuch towels he can raiſe himſelf better that way than others may. Then ſpread plaiſters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and more than you have need to uſe; and cut alſo the ſplinters orderly, as you heard before, for afterward that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion you are bereaved of when you are about the dreſſing of him; make the ſplinters not too long, nor to ſharp, not too ſtraight, nor too crooked, not too ſmall, nor too broad, not too ſhort, nor too weak, not too thin, nor too hollow; and to fit it well to the Wound, is no ſmaller manual than the dreſſing it ſelf; for a binding can be renewed and altered every day, but it is a harder matter to alter the ſplinters and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106818:94"/> plaiſters. Note alſo, if there be need of ſome broad ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where great holes are cut into the whole piece of it, theſe hold the more ſtrongly and ſtiffely; two of ſuch may be laid oppoſite one to another, and weaker ſplinters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; but if the Fracture be ſo great, that without ſtirring it the reſt could not be fitted, then have in readineſs ſome Iron ones, which be fit for it, even as the wooden ones, and are better for to handle the Patient withal.</p>
                  <p>For I dreſſed once a Patient at <hi>Lentzburg,</hi> whoſe bone Fracture had thirteen Wounds, all which I dreſſed thrice a day, and the Wounds were of that bigneſs, that I was fain to leave open thirteen vent-holes, and ſtill opening one knot after the other on the Fracture, and tied them again with a knot one after another, and ſtill kept the Fracture firmly tied. I ſhould hardly be bleived, if I ſhould ſpeak of the toil and moil I had with it, and I had no ſooner ended one dreſſing, but I was fain to undo the firſt again to cleanſe and dry it, for the matter was ſo troubleſome betwixt the skin, the plaiſter, and the ſplinter, that I was afraid the Worms would engender there, for I never took the firſt band wholly off from the Fracture, elſe I muſt have held his Foot in my Hand, if I had taken off the bands, ſplinters and plaiſters; therefore I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him thus, that to day I opened one knot and ſplinter, and the reſt at other times as I ſaw occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Reader, I tell you the truth, that you may ſee what ought to be done at ſuch a huge Fracture, which may not be dreſt as one would. And when I intended to dreſs him again, then I took ſtrong ſplinters, theſe I applied upon, that I might not ſtir and diſturb him. As you heard, how you ought to fit your ſelf for common Fractures, ſo you muſt prepare your ſelf here in this the rather, becauſe you muſt look to ſuch Flap-wounds every day, and yet you muſt not ſtir the Fracture.</p>
                  <p>The ſplinters muſt not too cloſe be applied to the Wound, but let it have vent, for they will move too cloſe to it for all that. And ſuch Fractures muſt be dreſſed like another Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, onely the firſt band is left unbuttened, and that band muſt not be bound juſt on the Wound, which muſt yet ſtand
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106818:95"/> free and open, and not touch any other band or ſplinter; afterward dreſs the Wound as you pleaſe, and tie the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, plaiſters, ſalves and bolſters about, as if the bone were whole and unbroken, be it on the Leg or Arm, even as if you were to dreſs a freſh Wound.</p>
                  <p>The bands wherewith you intend to bind, lay them down on the linnen before you lay down his Leg, as you have been told formerly; and though you are to ſpread the ſplinters with the Fracture-ſalve (as you have heard before) yet I mean no other ſplinters, but ſuch which are not to be removed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when the whole band is taken off. But the little bands, which muſt be daily undreſſed, and the bolſters and roulers, theſe muſt not come to the plaiſters ſalve to make them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that if the plaiſter come to them it may not ſtick unto, for if that ſhould be, you could never take them off again without ſtirring the Fracture, and the ſplinters could not be left unſtirred neither.</p>
                  <p>The laſt applied ſplinter muſt be ſtiffer and ſtronger than the other, for that muſt keep in the Fracture by force, that it do not get out again out of the Wound; and the Wound muſt be provided with bolſters beneath the ſplinter, elſe the fleſh goeth out of the Wound. and the bones would then be left naked, and hardly admit any healing, and the bones being naked will grow rugged from the air, and the panicle fals off from the bone, which would make the bones to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no fleſh, neither is the Fracture deſirous of any, and it is dangerous at the firſt day, to keep the bones and Fracture together, when the panicle is looſe it ſeldom cloſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>To prevent theſe dangers, and to keep the Fractures from diſ-joyning, and that it need not to be ſo ſtrongly tied, and that the fleſh may the better ſtay there and fall not off; then before you dreſs him, firſt view and meaſure it well, and cut the hole into the plaiſter, and lay it about (like a ring) and chiefly on that which ſtandeth out higher, and will come out further (even as I have written before of ordinary Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and cloſed ones) that the ring about the Wound keep in the bone, and then the ſplinters alſo of the firſt band
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106818:95"/> help to keep the Fracture off, and not thoſe that were applied laſt, &amp; thoſe that are laid laſt do not pinch the fleſh ſo much, as when they were laid flat upon.</p>
                  <p>Though you make the bolſters never ſo ſoft, if you bind hard, it cloſeth and preſſeth the fleſh in ſo much, that it goeth away the more, and leaveth the bones naked, then theſe bones will never admit of a cure. But you muſt make that ring thus, that by the ſplinters you may know whether they reſt upon the ring and do not touch the Wound; that is, on that high place, where the bone ſtrives to get out, you muſt lay a four-double plaiſter, but to the other ſide, where it doth not ſtrive to get out, there you lay but a three doubled plaiſter and about the whole Leg but a ſingle one. But if you have laid a double plaiſter about the whole Leg, as I often uſe to do, that the band may draw and hold the ſtronger, then you muſt lay it thicker about the Wound, by reaſon you took the other double; all this is to be obſerved, according as the Fracture goeth out and is hollow; for the Fracture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very hollow and deep. <note place="margin">A Flap-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture made with a Cart-wheel.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example, if a Cart-wheel breaketh ſuch a Fracture, it preſſeth not the bone out by the Wound, but commonly preſſeth it upward, and for the moſt part cuts off the fleſh above, and forceth the bone into the Wheels track. Here you ſee it is done on the contrary, therefore the bolſters alſo muſt be laid contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> to the whole ſide, even as in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Fracture which is not open, here you need not that ring about the Wound, but a plain ſplinter muſt be applied on the Wound, with a plain bolſter, plaiſter and ointment, and other things belonging thereto, that the materials may run into, and the band be not fouled; the ſame alſo muſt be obſerved in other Wound-dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Reader, by way of admonition I told and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this unto you, that when you meet with any ſuch danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſimptoms in Fractures, that it may be a rule unto you how to deal with them, and not to put the Patient into pains. For in ſuch things I was many time perplexed, not knowing what to do, when the fleſh begun to go off from the bones, and ſtood naked like a dead mans bone.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106818:96"/>
                  <p> Once I had a Patient, born at <hi>Altſtad,</hi> who broke his bone twice above the Knee, to whom with others being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to look unto this heavy ſpectacle, I ſaw the middle moſt piece about ſix thumbs breadth ſtanding naked from the fleſh, going about to get it in again, behold on the other end it was off the fleſh, for he had two fall Fractures on the Thigh, I ſeeing that it was quite looſe, and without any ſtreaks, and looked like a dead mans bone, and I perceiving that it would ſtick no where, then I took it out quite, and dreſſed his Wound as Fractures uſually are dreſt, and ſet the two ends to their places as well as I could, and I healed him ſo, that he was able to follow his Calling, but he halted in his going as deep as the broken bone was long; there came ſuch corruption from this party, for horrors ſake I dare not write of it. This example is quoted for that purpoſe, that you ſhould not give over any broken bone or Member as long as there is any life in it, and this party carried it as well as any did with a ſtilt. Therefore be not too raſh in cutting off of Members, unleſs the thing well conſidered be found, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means left for to keep it on.</p>
                  <p>No bone ought to be taken out of a Wound, unleſs it be quite looſe, neither do ſearch much into the Wound with the little Seeker, as is uſually done, for ſuch bones will looſen themſelves, if they muſt be looſe; ſtroak the matter neatly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Wound, and look wel, that the Wound beneath grow not hollow, which uſually happeneth. For ſometimes the fleſh fals quite away which at firſt ſtuck, becauſe all was cruſhed and conſumed away, and ſmoaked continually; it muſt be cleanſed by reaſon of ſuch ſhowers, and ſtill wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which is falling, for which you muſt be ſtored with clean linnen.</p>
                  <p>Moreover theſe bands muſt be carefully handled, more than any bands you are to look to, therefore do not ſpoil the firſt band with binding, for it is better to bind it ſlack, than too hard, and it is better likewiſe to apply not too many ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo it is alſo with the plaiſters, to be ſparing here is better than to be laviſh. In a word, pains in Wounds are ſooner increaſed than diminiſhed with too many ſplinters, plaiſters,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106818:96"/> clothes, &amp;c. then the band holdeth ſo faſt, that you can hardly get it off; but if any of theſe be wanting, they may be ſupplied at any time, but if you exceeded in the former, you cannot mend that fault without putting the Patient into great pains; therefore let enough vent, and room as much as you may.</p>
                  <p>How perplexed was I many times in ſtudying out the beſt way to dreſs ſuch Fractures? ſometimes I made holes into the ſplinters; ſometimes I joyned two together, and ſo cut one proper piece out of it; ſometimes I laid two, one by the other, and yet left room enough to come to the Wound; and if hollow ones were fitting, I applied them, but I made all ſerve ſo, that I left the band untoucht and unaltered. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch caſes I had, which way to dreſs the Wound conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently I knew not; and when I ſaw it could be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that the band muſt be undreſt, I let it paſs for that time, thinking when the Patient and I am otherwiſe minded, then things ſhould be better conſidered of, and that which was defective for the preſent, I mended at the next dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>For the which I could quote many examples, how I was called out of my ſleep, finding many help and uſeleſs people about the Patient, and neither meaſuring nor fitting the true length or breadth of the ſplinters, I did my beſt, as well as I could, but this was my great comfort, I had room to let the green Ointment run into the Wound between the ſplinters, and afterward the Wound-ointment, and was not ſparing of it, and made it come into all places, and where I could not come to the Wound, I let ſome dayes paſs, in the interim ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it with the Salve and Ointment; then I took it off, and cut the ſplinters either ſhorter or narrower, yet not ſtirring nor moving the Fracture.</p>
                  <p>Now I have ſhewed unto you in brief, that if a Fracture, by reaſon of ſome obſtructions, cannot be dreſſed as it ought, <note place="margin">Flap-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note> what you are to do. For a Flap-wound is not like another ordinary Fracture; for though it be ſet well together and even, as much as poſſible it may, yet will it not ſtand and keep ſo firmly one upon another as ordinary Fractures will; becauſe their skin being whole, it ſooner clingeth to, doth not rot or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106818:97"/> feſter away, but clingeth freely to the other. But Flap-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, if much broken, and ſome ſplinters being broken out, they feſter and yeild much corruption, and fall quite away, though the bones thereof be ſet as well as can be, yet will they not keep together, and the fleſh of it feſtereth away, whereas in other Fractures the fleſh comes to good, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firmly. Therefore in ſuch Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p-fractures you muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more fleſh to grow than in any other Wound, and muſt be more cleanſed than any other Wound. For the marrow alſo in ſuch Fractures turns to matter, and runs out at the Wound, here fleſh muſt be made grow to fill up that place, which will not be done in a long time. This may happen alſo to an ordinary Fracture, however that fleſh which hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the panicle and ſtreaks, which alſo hangs on the bones, ſooner takes hold on the bone, than that fleſh which is but growing like a new twig.</p>
                  <p>Courteous Reader, I will propound you a true example, with all the circumſtances to the full. I had once a Patient, whoſe Leg was pulled off by a roap, by his treading in the roap, which quickly parted it, at which time was drawn up a Beech-tree, which fell on this Mans Leg, between the Ankle and the Knee, and broke ſuch a long Wound, that I ſtartled at it when I ſaw it; for the Leg was off, hanging onely on a little piece, and I wondered much, how any life could be left in it; I ſaw no help for him, being farre from people in a Farmers houſe, and that happened in a Winters night, where I had no accommodation, and could not dreſs him as he ought; I cut off the bruiſed, broken and torn fleſh, veins and muſcles with ſheers, for it was broken ſo much, that it looked like out-worn fringes, and was very black. I dreſt him as well as I could, and laid him down in the beſt manner the place would afford, and had ſmall hopes of his Foot, for I was afraid it would fall off every moment. I let him lie, being he was not much pained, neither was there any ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I put a great deal of Ointment into it, I cleanſed it in the beſt manner I could, and when I dreſt him, then I thought, now the Foot fals off, becauſe the danger was ſo great. But God gave a bleſſing, his Foot kept on; when I came to dreſs
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106818:97"/> him at the fifteenth day, I was deſirous to ſee how the Leg &amp; Foot did look, after I cleanſed him carefully, I ſaw that the torn fleſh and veins were ſeparated and purged, but the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and the bones I diſliked in their poſture. I took his Foot and turned it to the Knee-ward, and viewed the bones to ſee where they hung yet, and ſo I ſet his bones now toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if the Fracture had been done newly; then I found a dried beech leaf in the bone, which I took out, and cleanſed the Fracture as well as I could, and made ready a band for him, with ſplinters and other neceſſary things, and ſo I dreſt him.</p>
                  <p>This notable example, courteous Reader, I quote for no other end, but that Surgeons ſhould not make too much haſte for cutting off of deſperate Members, before the Wound and Fracture be fully cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>I intreat you not to cut off Members, though they be cruſhed and ſhattered in pieces, much leſs ſuch that are wounded lame; for I have ſeen things grow on again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any mans expectation. Therefore be careful, and be not too raſh in cutting off of Members: For my ſelf have cured Legs, Feet, Arms, with Gods bleſſing, which ordinary Surgeons had condemned to be cut off, which were kept on through my help; I do not ſpeak here beyond exceptions; for I alſo have cut off Fingers, Nails, Toes, Legs and Arms; I ſpeak onely of that great haſty raſhneſs, when they fall on cutting at firſt, where at the tenth dreſſing it ſhould be forborn, as long as the Member is not quite ſeparated, nor the contuſed parts fall off ſtill and ſtink; for it will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continue in that ſtink (for the like I told you at the healing of ſinews, where the like ſtink enſueth.)</p>
                  <p>Surgeons are many times blinded, that when they come to cut into a Member, they find ſomewhat which looks freſh enough; and ſeeing there is ſome lively thing there, then ſurely there is more there than they could imagine.</p>
                  <p>But when neither hope, nor advice, nor any Medicine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, then I can ſay nothing againſt their diſmembring: Becauſe my ſelf have cut off neglected rotten Members, which were paſt all cures.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:106818:98"/>
                  <p> But I never dealt ſo upon freſh Wounds or Fractures, nor that at the firſt binding, but onely when ſuch bands were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and quite rotted off. There is a difference between freſh and rotten bands, and each requireth a due remedy. But to cut off a band, which to day, or two or three dayes ago was dreſt, that is no putrified fleſh, but a Member contuſed, or a part that had a hurt by a fall or cut; but if ſuch a Wound had been of half a yeers ſtanding, it may be held then for a putrified ulceration; and whether it laſted a longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, yet is it never reckoned among the firſt bands, for then is it already fallen to putrefaction unto matter, and not to ſeparation unto healing. For eight or twelve dayes are enough for a cleanſing, yet theſe things are conſidered of, according as the condition of the Fracture is. Therefore do not ſtand upon a two or three dayes band, but rather wait till ten dayes be paſt at the leaſt, before you fall to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of any part, which yet hangeth firmly, though ſome part of the skin ſeparateth. For as ſoon as it begins to raiſe and to ſeparate then there is hope that more of the contuſed part will remain. Therefore be not too haſty in cutting off ſuch a Joynt, which is of great uſe to the party, be it a cut, a blow, a contuſion, a burning, or a ſhot, or any other way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Conſider fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt very well, whether it may not be time enough, after three, five, or more dayes, to take the ſection in hand, for all rottening ſinews and veins do make a ſtink; but when it can be no otherwiſe, then I cannot ſay againſt it, for my ſelf did ſo. Sometimes ſuch contuſed ſinews and veins cauſe ſuch a ſtink, by reaſon of a cold, and hot fire that is therein, then ſeparateth the putrified fleſh from the ſound, in ſuch a manner, that it is to be admired.</p>
                  <p>If you come a Fracture which is not quite broken off, do not you take it off with your griping, groaping and ſeeking, but let it alone till you have ſufficiently viewed, if you ſeek not in it, it will ſwell the leſs, and fit it ſelf better for healing, nor the ſhattered pieces will prick the fleſh afreſh, nor the branches of the bone will break off or come atwhart. Try not whether it be yet ſtrong enough, unleſs you be ſure that it will be no hurt to the party. Let the party lie ſtill day and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106818:98"/> night till you cleanſe and dreſs him; uſe no Corroſives to the Wound for to cleanſe it withal, it cleanſeth it ſelf enough through the Wound-ointment, and caſts forth that which ſhould be caſt out; if you corrode it, you nip of the agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, and the bones turn to a blackneſs, and will hardly agglue again. Let him have a dry ſweating Bath to cleanſe him, and let him not come the whole year into a water Bath.</p>
                  <p>If the Fracture hath lain a long time, and you would fain ſet it up-right, and the Wound on the Flap-fracture is not yet healed, then is it dangerous to do it, eſpecially if the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is on the Thigh for there no bones grow together, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fleſh betwixt the ends, and is juſt as glue is betwixt two boards to hold them faſt together, ſo that fleſh holds the two ends of the bone together, for that reaſon is it called Horſe-fleſh, becauſe it is harder then other fleſh, and is ſofter than a Cartilage, and is very like the gums about the Teeth, and that <note place="margin">Horſe-fleſh.</note> holds the bones together one on another. Therefore if ſuch a party hath lain long, and many wait for his being ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, however do not you venter too ſoon to ſet him on his Leg (eſpecially if the Fracture is on the Thigh) unleſs the Wound of the Flap-fracture be well healed; if not, then is it a ſign, that the fleſh about the Fracture is not grown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor healed; for when that is healed, then the skin about the Wound healeth and cloſeth. The Ointment muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes run well into the Wound of the Flap-fracture, that the fleſh may grow from within, for on every part of the bone there groweth fleſh in the place where the marrow was, and is filled up with Horſe-fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the common ſaying is, that a broken bone after it is healed holds ſtronger than it did before the Fracture, by reaſon of that hard fleſh, which is very tough. That party which proveth well in fleſh about the body and the eyes, it is a ſign that his Fracture alſo will heal the ſooner.</p>
                  <p>I have cured ſuch parties, who were ſtrong in their going and ſtanding, feeling no weakneſs about the Fracture, but when they happened to fall ſick within that years time, either of a Head-ach, or a Feaver, Ague, or ſuch like, then about the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106818:99"/> Fracture they felt alſo a weakneſs, becauſe the fleſh of their bodies decaying, the fleſh alſo about the Fracture decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>I deſiſt from rehearſing any examples, becauſe Experience brings in enough daily. Therefore if the Wound of the Fracture be not quite healed and cloſed, then I hold it to be not ſtiffe and ſtrong enough to bear; therefore be warned, becauſe I know where ſuch faults have been committed, though the Fracture were reaſonably well cured, ſo that no complaint was about that, yet afterward complaints were made, becauſe the Patient was ſet too ſoon upon his Leg, and made too ſoon uſe of it, either by carrying too much, and outting his ſtrength too ſoon to the work, cauſing a relapſe to himſelf, and a re-fracture to his bone; the Surgeon is not in fault here, but the party muſt bear the blame.</p>
                  <p>Though you are aſſured enough of the healing and his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him upright, yet if the party would not be willing to bear two ſplinters about him, yet let him have one ſplinter about the Flap-fracture after healing, for if any chance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals him, it will appear in that place firſt.</p>
                  <p>This needs not to be done to an Arm fracture, neither the Fractures below the Knee need to wear ſplinters ſo long a time as thoſe on the Thigh muſt, becauſe the great and ſmal bones of the Leg help to bear one another, and in the Thigh there is but one bone, which will not hold together ſo well if once broken.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome, who by all means would have Fractures ſalved and annointed, and will not beleive the Patient can be healed, unleſs he be ſo annointed and ſalved; but you are to forbear, and be afraid of ſuch dawbings. When a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is incident to a bone, then you may annoint the party, if of growing years, being above twelve, and under twenty years, in their bones is a ſhortneſs and ſmalneſs, and that holdeth not long neither. And this makes me to bring in a Compariſon of two twigs of a Tree, the one was bowed and nibbled by beaſts, the other was not, the nibbled one could not prove ſo well as that which was not nibbled. So it is with the bones in young growing people when they are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106818:99"/> wounded, the hurt bone ſtands ſtill, or is ſomewhat hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its growing, but the ſound bone groweth mainly, and ſo the one is not like the other in the growth, and that muſt be mended with Medicaments that warm and rarifie the bloud, that it overtake in growing that, it laſt in the ſtill ſtanding, and be equal with the other.</p>
                  <p>I had a party in cure, whoſe Feet grew unequal, and the one Leg alſo was longer than the other; here I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, not becauſe the Leg I cured conſumed away, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the other out grew it, which had a greater ſupply of pure and thin bloud than the other, which was under cure, and hindered in its growing, by the poſture the Leg lay in, and the wounded ſinews, and the ill ſetting of the bone. To further the growing of this ſhort Leg I did thus; after the Fracture was healed, I rubbed and ſtroaked the inſide of the Leg, and going to annoint it, I applied a band where the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was, or elſe I had one that held that place ſtrongly; then I annointed the Leg very well above and below the Fracture, alwayes warming my hands; I never toucht the Leg with cold hands, warming alſo the bands and plaiſters, and let the Leg hang down, when I annointed it, I did not gripe the Leg hard, but the skin I ſtroaked freely. More of this ſhall be ſaid in the Chapter which handleth of exiccated Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>I intend now to ſpeak of ſwelled Fractures, which are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Of ſwelled Members and Joynts.</note> yet are ſtill thick and groſs, and that one Joynt and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is as heavy as two in the going or ſtanding, which thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I took away without cauſing any pain. I had ſeveral ſuch ſwelled Members, which amaze the beholder, yet the Lord gave a bleſſing to their healing, but ſome ſigns were left behind.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why I ſpeak now of ſwelled Members is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe formerly I have written of exiccated Members, theſe being contraries, that Surgeons may take notice how to help theſe ſimptoms, for that which is good for the one is nought for the other, and a wet Bath is nought for both, but in other things contraries are uſed; <hi>viz.</hi> if you have in hand a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and up-dried Member, you muſt ſtroak it downwards,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106818:100"/> and a ſwelled Member you muſt ſtroak upward at the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. If in an Arm or Leg a humour remained, and is not a ſwelling cauſed by ſome ulceration of a wounded and lamed part, be it of a fall or a blow, be the cauſe what it will, either itch, ſmall pox, imbroidered clothes, hard and long labour, or a long down-hanging of the Member, or an ulcerated Fracture, or a great ſcabbedneſs redneſs, dropſie, &amp;c. of all theſe I do not ſpeak, but of a humour of the body, where there is neither redneſs, anger, nor water. Here you may judge if you be judicious, of what humour I do ſpeak. Such means muſt not be uſed, ſpoken of formerly, for ſwelled Members, whereby the Patients Member would eaſily be mortified, and death enſues upon. Look well and conſider what ſwellings are ſpoken of here, all ſorts of ſwellings are not yet related, as among the reſt, the ſwellings of lamed Members, which have neither ſpots, nor biles, or holes, ſuch may be dreſt in the manner ſpoken of, and bound not ſo hard as the firſt. Such ſimptoms are incident to Knees, Elbows, Shoulders, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, but ſeldom to other places.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If a Flap-fracture be ſo great, that whole pieces of the Leg come out, you muſt not therefore cut off that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <note place="margin">When the bones are gone out.</note> as many would do, but ſet the bones right again one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, and let Nature provide for the reſt. Theſe bones will grow together again, but the Member groweth ſhorter.</p>
                  <p>I could quote many examples ſerving to that purpoſe, where the two bones of the Leg were taken out ſome fingers breadth, which were ſet again from below upward, and were healed ſucceſsfully, but the Leg fell as much ſhorter as thoſe pieces were long that came out.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF a Patient hath a broken Arm above or below the Elbow, ſet him on a ſtrong ſtool, tie his ſound Arm to the ſtool, or let him be held ſtrongly by that Arm, that he may not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you in your work, and do it well at firſt, that you may have no diſgrace afterward, and the Patient be put to further miſery, for if his Arm be not well ſet at firſt, afterward you will hardly do it, and the Joynt will be pained a long time, which at firſt was not well ſet, therefore preſently ſtretch the diſlocated Arm, and ſet it well one upon another, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well ſet it, then have good help about ye, eſpecially when you have in hand any great Fracture in Arms or Legs. For the greater the Fracture is, the ſtronger help you muſt have, and one body alone is not ſufficient, unleſs your Patient be hearty and willing to endure; when you are about to dreſs him, let him lay his Arm on a cuſhion in his lap, in the mean while be you ready with your plaiſters, ſplinters; bolſters, roulers, needle and threed, and ſtitch-plaiſters, as you heard above. To an in-bowed Member you need but two ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the one to lie to the bowing, to keep in that raiſing or calluſity, and the other muſt lie oppoſite to it, to be helpful to that which lieth on the bowing, for one alone will not keep it down ſufficiently. But if the Fracture be great, and on a ſtrong Joynt and Member, then you muſt uſe four ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which will be the ſafeſt way, for ſplinters will hardly be ſo broad as to keep the roulers off from in-printing, and when four ſplinters are laid, then the bands or roulers cannot come ſo nigh to it; on that ſplinter which lieth on the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place or bulk lay another ſmaller ſplinter, it will hold the ſtronger, and ſpread a little of the Fracture ſalve to it, that it may not ſlide away, for if you lay two ſplinters one upon another, the one muſt be broader than the other, to keep that raiſed part the better in, and will ſlide off the leſs. Have a care
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106818:101"/> you do not bind it too hard, nor too ſlack; the hard binding is dangerous and deſtructive to the Member, cauſing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and dying, and a ſlack binding is hurtful alſo, but not ſo much as the other, cauſing a crookedneſs in the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the band yeildeth, and the Fracture begins to raiſe or to ſlide, though that raiſing may be helped, but not ſo well as when it had been done well at firſt; the Patient muſt lie very quiet, neither ſtirring or turning much, be the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the Arm or Leg.</p>
                  <p>Though I ſpeak here of in-bowed Members, think not that I mean onely ſuch, for hereby you have further information for all other Fractures, be they broken in what manner they will, for an in-bowed Joynt or bone requireth as much toil, as if it were quite broken: there is a very ſmall difference between a Fracture and an in-bowed bone; a Fracture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth care, that it ſtir not and go aſunder, but an in-bowed bone if once preſſed or turned right will keep ſo, but ſo doth not a Fracture, eſpecially that above the Elbow and that on the Thigh, that ſtriveth alwayes to get out again, for theſe bones commonly are ſomewhat crooked naturally, that is the reaſon why it doth not keep its ſtanding, and that bone is in ſome ſtraighter than in others.</p>
                  <p>Now if you can ſet right an in-bowed bone, much more may you do it in a Fracture; an in-bowed bone well ſet, keeps the place, but a plain Fracture hath more wayes to get out again: I have ſeen alſo, that in the looking to it I was put to more trouble then I had at the firſt ſetting it right: it is not ſo with in-bowed bones, for that doth not go out any ſide, unleſs you force it ſuch a way in the turning of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not over do it, make it not worſe, as ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight rudely may be committed, where a Fracture is put out of its place, which would have kept together. There is great advantage here, both in the work and pains in the healing and growing.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, the cure is half done, if a Fracture ſet keeps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for if once ſtruck aſunder, then the ſplinters and teeth break, and the bones alſo break unequally, becauſe they break not ſo, as when they are ſawed and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t aſunder, but at their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106818:101"/> breaking they tear into many ſplinters, and many times can hardly be brought together again. And if any of theſe ſplinters cometh atwhart, the ſame is a hinderance unto heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bringing an unevenneſs in the going and ſtanding, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing the whole work.</p>
                  <p>That branch or ſplinter which is in a croſs way, puzleth Surgeons, that they know not where the defect is, and if ſo be they know it to be a ſplinter, but how will they turn it? my adviſe is, if the Fracture be not quite aſunder, let it keep ſo, that with medling with it you may not cauſe one ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other, for to fall a twhart; I cannot give warning enough here, becauſe the dangers are great in ſuch caſes, which I have known and felt.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving ſpoken enough of Flap-fractures, now it follows <note place="margin">Split Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note> that I ſpeak alſo of Fractures cloven and burſt. I call this a ſplit or gaping Fracture, when a bone is ſplit and burſt either with a thruſt, blow, fall, or how as it may be done in any way; which ſplit or cleft is not a plain Fracture, but onely a rent, crack, like a crack in a glaſs, which to ſay is yet whole for all the crack.</p>
                  <p>If any come to you, complaining of a bone which is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">To know a cracked Fracture.</note> ſwelled, and paineth him when he toucheth it, or when he treadeth hard on that Foot, it betokeneth that that Leg is craked You are to apply the before named Fracture-plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the ſplinters, as you heard before, and ſo let the party lie ſtill for ſome dayes; that plaiſter will draw out the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture which is in the Legs, and the patient will quickly be healed.</p>
                  <p>But if it be of a high ſwelling and feeleth ſoft, it is a ſign, that a moiſture is gathered there from the bloud and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106818:102"/> bone. Lance that place, make vent for that humour, put a tent into the place covered with the little brown ointment, and dreſs it as a Flap-fracture, it will ſoon mend.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt needs ſpeak of ſome abuſes, which many have <note place="margin">Abuſe.</note> committed. When they are about to cure ſuch Patients, and undertake to do it, then they will perform it with annointing, bathing, waſhing, and ſuch like. But it is ſeldom ſeen, that it is to any purpoſe. Yea (which is a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) they cauſe ſuch hurts thereby that can never be cured. That hurt, which is cauſed thereby, is called by ſome Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Marrow-wounds, the original whereof to deſcribe here <note place="margin">Marrow hurts.</note> is needleſs.</p>
                  <p>If a bone be cracked, it may be the party doth ſlight it for <note place="margin">Cracked bones not preſently felt.</note> the preſent, eſpecially if the bone be crackt all along, it will hardly cauſe any pains to the party in a twelve moneths time: if ſuch a crack be ſo ſubtile, that it is not felt in ſo long a time, however the marrow in that bone hath vent.</p>
                  <p>Now as Nature in man cannot endure any Fracture, be it as little as it will, but it will complain of it one time or other; that crack in the bone will bring forth its excrement, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is very little, yet in time it will come to ſome matter, which ſettleth to the lower part of the bone toward the Ankle, and the crack alſo in the mean time goes on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, becauſe its own excrements ſtay there, and are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled through Medicaments. That moiſture being gathered to any quantity, it will ſeek for an iſſue in the end, and cauſeth a ſimptom, which commonly at the firſt appearance is like to Anthonies fire with a bliſter upon.</p>
                  <p>Such things admit afterward no healing in that place where they are, becauſe their fountain and original is not there. For many times one hurts himſelf on the Shin, and that hurt breaks forth at the Ankle, becauſe the humour ſettleth down. Such hurts being healed will break out again, not regarding the skin, and will not be mended neither with diet nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then they call it a Belly-flux, which is none at all.</p>
                  <p>I have cured ſuch ſimptoms of twelve or fifteen years <note place="margin">Cracks are no Belly-flux.</note> ſtanding, which by all Surgeons that had them in hand were counted Belly-fluxes, whereas they had no other original
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106818:102"/> but what was told. It fals out, that in ſuch caſes many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are ſpoiled, becauſe Surgeons undertaking to cure ſuch hurts, know not their original, which is the chiefeſt thing here. But how theſe ſhall be known well, and fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, you will find it in its due place, when I ſhall treat of all manner of ſimptoms.</p>
                  <p>Here is a neceſſary Quaery: How can any man go about his work with a cracked Arm, and how can a party ſtand or go whoſe Leg is craked?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer: Yes, it may be, which I know not by hear ſay alone, but have ſeen it: Mr. <hi>Jurian</hi> of <hi>Weſlen</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Surgeon found it ſo in himſelf; he had a Fracture on his Leg, but went about a long time, till at laſt he was fain to yeild, and in his down-lying he often conferred with me about it, telling me, that he marvelled, that he could ſtand and go about ſo long having a cracked Leg. From hence I infer, that a party may have a cracked Arm or Leg, yet for all that he may follow his occaſion, but in what manner it is, he knoweth it beſt that hath the Fracture; and it may be, that ſuch parties are limping. Some Fractures are ſuch, that the party is not able to tread on that Foot, though the whole houſe ſhould be on fire. Fractures are not all alike, break not alike, and their healing is not done one manner of way,</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why ſome can do their work and go about is in my judgement, becauſe in the fore part of the Arm are two bones, as alſo on the Leg, if onely one of theſe bones be crackt, the other holds ſtrong yet, and ſo the party doth his work, though in pains; but it is another thing with the bone above the Knee and above the Elbow; and ſo there is a difference in ſuch cracks.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of cracked bones, what they are; ſome examples quoted.</head>
                     <p>Theſe are called crackt Fractures which are not apparent, it is not unknown what ſuch parties ail, they complain, and know why, and ignorant Surgeons having them in hand, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them ſo long, till the hurt breaketh out, and counting it ignorantly to be a Belly-flux or humour, in the upſhut they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106818:103"/> call it a Sprain. Of theſe I quote ſome examples, that you may know what I do call a crackt Fracture, and what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it is.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Maid coming home ward loaden with bought Wares, fell on a ſtone in the ſtreet, after ſhe roſe ſhe went on her way, though with pain, and coming home ſhe annointed the place to diſperſe the bloud, and this annointing ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for half a year, at laſt it broke out with great pain and ſtink, it was held to be a humour of the body, which they dawbed with Plaiſters for a whole year, but it would not come to any healing.</p>
                     <p>This Maid was brought to me, perceiving the cauſe of it, I deſired her to let me open it, there I found a Fracture with a cut, and the bone began to be ſcaled and black, I took it out, cleanſed the ſore, and cured it as a cracked bone, and ſhe was healed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Maid gathering Apples under a tree, taking up a load of them on her head, going along ſhe ſtept into a hole, broke her ſhin in pieces; ſhe ſate down, ſtaying for her Father to lead or carry her home; her Father coming, chid her, bidding her to riſe, telling her, that ſome vein or other ſhe did ſprain; ſhe went on that Fracture ſome hundred paces, and made it thereby worſe and worſe, at laſt ſhe could not tread upon it: I was ſent for, I told, that her bone was broke, I was laughed at, they ſaying, it were not poſſible a body ſhould tread on it if the bone were broken, much leſs to go ſo farre as ſhe did after her fall. Their beleif was brought to experience upon their own peril. For the bones went aſunder, and the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture began to grow too big for her to endure, and for me to heal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Man ſervant carrying a bundle of graſs, perceived he cracked his Leg, yet he went on, and in pains he carried home the graſs with much ado. This fellows Fracture was of ſo great difficulty to be ſet and healed, as ever I had any, for when I lanced it, it was found to be enough for one Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A young man taking down from a Horſe a ſack of ſalt broke his bone, for all that he went about for ſome dayes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106818:103"/> but at laſt the bones broken appeared in good earneſt, many Surgeons had him in cure before I came to him, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a real Fracture, which at firſt it would not be taken to be one.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Barber riding along, came among Horſes which fought among themſelves, by their kicking his Leg was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he felt it well enough that it was ſo, but he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was broken in two; lighting from his Horſe he went into his houſe, and in his going it was not ſeen by the boot whether he was hurt or no, the boot being pulled off, he tried whether he could go, but could not, for the two bones of the Leg were beaten in pieces; I had to do enough to cure them, and were healed without limping.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A Girl carrying a basket full of chips, and ſtepping over a block heard her bone give a ſnap, ſhe flings in the chips at the door, ſits down on the next block, but her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being hard to her, made her go for all that, this Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was lanced afterward, and was long under the cure.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A Servant had a Fracture, which I judged to be a lame one, I was laughed at, becauſe I called it a Fracture, but it was paſt laughing, when I took out the bone from the gartering place to the Ankle. For thoſe Surgeons which ſaw him, thought it a thing impoſſible, that he ſhould be able to go when his bone was in pieces, and many agreed with theſe Surgeons it was ſo. But the Patient ſaid, my bone is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; I preſently opened the place, opened the fleſh to the bone, which was black, becauſe the marrow preſt thorough the Fracture, but he was healed, could leap and jump without halting at all.</p>
                     <p>Many more examples I could quote, but forbear it, and rather tell the cauſe why any one can go for all his bone be broken: <hi>viz.</hi> if a bone be broken ſo, that the Fracture hath branches and ſplinters, theſe hold the bones ſtill together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtands together yet and beareth up the Patient; as when ones bone be not well healed, he goeth but in pains and with much ado, more than one whoſe bone is but broken lately.</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:106818:104"/>
                     <p> A Servant broke the bone next to the hand, complained much, his Miſtreſs applied to it Vinegar and Bran; I coming to dreſs the old Womans Sore on her Leg, I looked on the Lad, knew what he ailed, but would ſay nothing for fear they ſhould give me the lie; the Lad complained more and more, at laſt I was bid to ſee what he ailed; I told, that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine applied could do no good, for the Lads Arm is broken, and it was ſo as I ſaid, and the Lad had no reſt, and it was worſe with him every day, then my words were found true. The Lads Hand being grown crooked, then they gave leave that he ſhould be dreſt. I ſet his bone right, dreſt him, he felt eaſe, and his Hands ſwelling was allayed.</p>

                     <head>How cracked Fractures may be learned, or diſcerned, in old and young Folks.</head>
                     <p>If you have a Patient, whoſe Arm or Leg is red, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſwelling, and the redneſs doth not alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at firſt, but after, when it beginneth to ſwell, and will break out; if ſuch a thing appeareth, then ask the Patient how long that ſign was there, if he can tell, then you may the better diſcern the hurt, but if he cannot tell, either by reaſon of his young age, not able to ſpeak being a Child, then feel it hard, and try whether you feel any unevenneſs, or any thing broken; ask again, where he doth feel any pain, if he be able to anſwer you. But if a Child, take notice where it ſhrinketh at if toucht, whether there be a hollowneſs, or a bump, or any other crookedneſs, and at the feeling of the place take notice whether it doth ſtir, if you find it to do ſo, and giveth a ſnap, or you can feel the hollowneſs, or it yeilds to bowing, then is it ſurely a Fracture; and if it ſhould not yeild to bowing, and yet the other ſigns are at hand, which you felt with your <note place="margin">Signs of a crack-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</note> hands, then is it ſurely a crack, which holdeth ſtiffely yet, and the party can ſtand upon it, and go, and can work, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could think that he ailed any thing.</p>
                     <p>In caſe you are not yet ſure by feeling, bowing, &amp;c. then take notice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106818:104"/> crack or ſnap, and what work he had done: whether it came by a jump, lift, fall, thruſt, blow, or ſlipping into a pit, or by ſtriding over ditches, or climbing up the Ladder, or hurting himſelf againſt the bedſted. For I had Patients which broke their Arms by turning in their beds, and proved plain Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, apparent to the eye and feeling.</p>
                     <p>It happened, that at <hi>Nefel</hi> in <hi>Glaris</hi> I was to ſee a Boy to know what ailed him, no body knew, but I conceived what it might be, though I knew not the manner of it, I held it to come either from a blow, fall, &amp;c. But the Boy and the reſt ſaid it was grown ſo, but I ſaid, it was a hurt, be it done what time it would. I intending to be gone, his Nurſe ſaid to the Boy, I remember you fell from the cheſt, when you were ramping with another Boy, and after that you complained. Then he confeſſed, ſaying, I remember it, for ever ſince I felt my ſelf every day worſe.</p>
                     <p>From hence we gather, that Surgeons muſt not eaſily be miſled, though they ſay no hurt befel the Child, it came of it ſelf! For Servants will conceal things, when they let a Child fall, or other wayes hurt it by their careleſneſs: but when I felt the crack or ſwelling, then they put it off, ſaying, it was done at night in their bed, to ſhun their Maſters diſpleaſure; nay, Children themſelves will conceal the true cauſes of their hurts, for fear of offending their Parents. And ſome Parents are ſuperſtitious, ſuppoſing their Children are bewitched, when they ſee their healing doth not come off ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

                     <p>This Sore had ſeveral names put upon it, becauſe it was known but to few; ſome call it a Worm, of which opinion I am, for ſuch a ſore may very well deſerve ſuch a name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it feeds like a Worm every day more and more, and grows bigger, becauſe the marrow that preſt thorough the bone cannot be reduced to its own place again, from whence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106818:105"/> it once came, it ſearcheth further, and preſſeth ſo far, that it muſt needs break out thorough the skin. It is called a Worm, becauſe it gnaweth, panteth and pulleth, continually prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cauſeth miſerable pains before it comes to a ripeneſs, and before the fleſh putrifieth and dyeth. Sometimes it fals out to the loſs of that Joynt. He that had ſuch a Sore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what to ſay of it. In my Judgement it is a gnawing Worm, and not a ſleeping one, as ſome put that name upon it, becauſe it doth cauſe no ſleep to the party, but keeps him awakened in pain and torments. It is called alſo the not-named, or (a whats you call) an unknown Sore, no body knows what it is. Seeing it is unknown, never had its true name put upon it, then let it have its name, and ſay, this ſore Finger is a cracked Fracture, and it is ſo indeed, let others ſay of it what they pleaſe, I found it to be ſo. And this Sore hath its original from thence; if a Finger hath received wrong, and the foremoſt bone is hurt, then in time that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall moiſture deſireth to get out by that little rent (for as ſoon as a bone is cracked then it fals out ſo) betwixt the bone and the fleſh, which covereth that bone, and is tough and ſtrong like a tendon, where the fatneſs lieth, and being it is removed from its place, needs muſt it begin to putrifie and break through the fleſh: then pain and miſery groweth on, the bone inflameth and feſtereth. From thence it comes into the fleſh, then ſorrows begins, and the Joynt muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, if on the Toe, the Foot may be lamed, if the ſinew or joynt water comes to it, which is clear and yellow, cauſing more danger; if that Sore goeth further, a whole Member, Hand or Foot may be loſt, or a whole Arm, if not death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows altogether. I have ſeen a Hand cut off, by reaſon of ſuch a cracked Fracture, which being opened and ſearched; the cauſe was found of all that miſchief. Hence we gather, how from ſmall Sores great ſimptoms may ariſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may well be called the not-named (or what's ye call it) becauſe their firſt cauſe or original is unknown.</p>

                     <p>If there be a crack on the Shin, it fals out that that crack inclineth to feſter, which maketh a hollowneſs that begins in time to be moiſt; a hollowneſs being made, the moiſture ſoaketh lower; if ſo, then is the cauſe worſe; for though you ſhould open that Sore where that matter is, and you would heal it, you will miſs your aim do what ye can: My advice is, to open ſuch a thing before the matter be ſettled to any place, becauſe that moiſture breaks not forth ſo eaſily as it doth in any other Sore, for it is a meer water, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turns to matter.</p>
                     <p>For when you open that hurt at the place where the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is, then you may the eaſier come at it, then if you open it at a further diſtance from the crack, and that crack will heal the ſooner, the nearer it be opened to the Fracture; and in caſe you were to take out any bones, were it not fitter there to do it there then at a further diſtance? how ſhall the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or looſe bones get out, if thus neglected and let alone till feſtered? And the bones that are deſirous to get out are commonly black, ſtand ſeldom looſe, but hold faſt, and muſt be forced out with an inciſion Knife or other Inſtrument: in caſe you will ſtay the bones leaſure to get out of its own accord, there is no way for them but by putrifaction, if ſo, then you may look for many of them; it will prove a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cure and to no purpoſe; for ſcarrs, ſhort Members, halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, crooked bodies, &amp;c. yea, a perpetual ſign it will leave behind.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106818:106"/> ſimptoms. About the year 1540. the whole Company of Surgeons at <hi>Zurich</hi> hath been baffled and put to a non-plus by Sprains and ſmall cracked bones, ſome whereof I will rehearſe, that were under cure a whole tvvelve moneths, ſome ſix moneths, ſome two years, ſome more, ſome leſs, before they came to my hands, theſe muſt be a warning to Novices in Surgery. Some of the Patients may be a witneſs this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year 1563. what toil and moil, what pains they were put to, how their Members were cut off, others condemned to be cut off. Why? By reaſon of a Sprain, a ſmall hurt or fall, which brought ſome to a lameneſs, ſome to a moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful halting, and thoſe were glad which came off with an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or eaſie limping.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Taylors Widdow ſprain'd her Foot, after ſhe had been plaiſtered and dawbed with Salves a long time, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons reſolved twice at a meeting to ſaw the Foot off; but at laſt with much ado ſhe was cured, and her Foot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Maſon ſprain'd his Leg coming down a Ladder, who lay a long time under Surgeons hands, who in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his Leg to be ſawed off; no help for it, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forrain Surgeons were called to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I had two Brothers at <hi>Knenou</hi> in cure, whoſe black bones I digged out with much ado, the one was perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the other not ſo well, however he went his wayes: all this came from a Sprain.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Millers Daughter at <hi>Cloten</hi> ſprain'd her Foot, and was a long time under the Surgeons hands, but ſhe was ſo well dawbed, that the bone putrified and grew black, then was ſhe brought to me, I cut to the bone, and cured her, that ſhe was able to go about her buſineſs again.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. One had a fall from a Ladder, and had ſome hurt on his Leg, he did lie a long time under Surgeons hands before he was brought to me, never had I a more difficult cure in hand, his Leg could not be ſaved, but off it was cut, and his life paid for it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A Servant going about ſome buſineſs, he heard his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106818:106"/> Leg give a ſnap, which he ſlighted for the preſent, and went many dayes about, but into the Surgeons hands he fell, where being ſalved a while, at laſt he was brought to me alſo: Some told me what he ailed, but I found what it was; his bone from the gartering to the ankle, I opened it, and then dreſt him, and cured him, ſo that he went his way without the fore bone of his Leg: this broken bone, though it made no ſhew that it was broken, however it was ſo, and the party endured pains enough before he could be cured.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In <hi>Einſidle</hi> at <hi>Shobechlin,</hi> one at the taking up a load of graſs heard his Leg give a ſnap, and went on it for a while for all that, but his bone putrified, as the reſt of the quoted examples did, in the preſence of his Parents I opened it, they ſaw that it was putrified, and I cured it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A Woman at <hi>Geroltſwill</hi> going down ſome where, ſprain'd her Leg, it was ſwelled as much as ever I ſaw any: I opened it, an abundance of corruption came out of it, after ſome dayes ſhe was cured with much ado, the bone was not black, all kept together, no ſhatterings nor ſplinters in it. Her life was much feared; all this came from a ſmall crack, I ſhould have hardly beleived it, that ſuch a ſmall crack ſhould cauſe ſo much miſchief, and a Woman to undergo ſo much miſery as ſhe did, for ſhe let it run on a long time before ſhe ſought for help, ſtill hoping an amendment.</p>

                     <p>Theſe hurts named before, came all at firſt from a Sprain, by falling, by ſtepping into a hole unawares, or by lifting of things, or ſtretchings and throwings: it is hardly beleived, that from ſuch ſmall things ſuch great miſchiefs ſhould ariſe; its ſtrange a man ſhould hurt himſelf in a ſlight manner, and to turn to a Fracture, which at the beginning appeared to be no ſuch matter. But when I opened and viewed ſuch hurts, then I perceived, that if they had been dreſt at the beginning like a ſingle crack, then it would not have turned to any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inconvenience without cauſing any further pain and trouble.</p>

In caſe the bone ſtands yet firm, then hold it together onely with a good Plaiſter, which muſt be broader than the Fracture, it will hold it more ſtrongly than if your plaiſter be applied ſparingly, and put a good rouler about it, let it lie ſo eight dayes, well tied together with the rouler, but not too hard, that the hurt be not endammaged. This muſt be underſtood of the fore part of the Arm toward the Hand, and the neather part of the Leg below the Knee.</p>
                     <p>That part of the Arm above the Elbow, and the thick part above the Knee, muſt not be dealt ſo withal, neither muſt you apply any ſplinter to it, becauſe there is but one bone in that place, which ſooner is ſtirred than the other bones below the Elbow or the Knee, of the which there are two, a bigger and a leſſer. The bone above the Knee or Elbow requireth better looking unto, not onely becauſe it is onely one bone, but alſo becauſe it muſt endure more in lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, going, ſtanding, glimming, carrying, than the other fore bones.</p>

                     <p>Experience ſheweth the contrary, that the upper part muſt be ſtronger than the fore part, Labourers and Foot-poſts know it; beſides, one bone is ſooner ſtirred and removed, then two ſtanding and up-bearing one another, and that one is fuller of Marrow, and is of a greater largeneſs, ſtands more hollow, and is ſooner removed by reaſon of that hollowneſs.</p>
                     <p>Therefore do not ſlight that upper part, though it be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crackt nor diſlocated, or not felt, for it is dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if painful in the touch.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:106818:108"/>
                     <p> Look you do not neglect it, but bind and dreſs it as well as you can. Apply a ſplinter above or at the uppermoſt part, if you do not, then you will have work enough for your ſelf and for the Patient. You apply here the ſplinters not as upon another Fracture, but onely one, or at the moſt two ſplinters are to be uſed, and a doubled plaiſter, it holds as ſtiffe as an armour. Let it lie ſo applied ten or twelve dayes, pull it well together with a rouler, it will endure a hard binding, more than that part below the Elbow or the Knee, for on thoſe parts a too hard binding may cauſe a deadneſs to the Foot or Hand, by reaſon of the muſcles and ſinews, which is not feared on the Thigh, or on the Arm above the Elbow.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not bind it too hard, eſpecially if your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is farre from you, and you cannot come ſoon to him; if it be a Child, whoſe Muſcles and ſinews are not ſtrong and cannot complain of it, as aged people may obſerve, and have the more care of it, be the Fracture what it will, either rent or crack, at the dreſſing and undreſſing; eſpecially have a care to the Marrow, that it do not preſs thorough, that it come not to ſtand between the bone and the fleſh, and cauſe no blackneſs to the bone, and the Marrow do not break thorough to a ſwelling, and turn to a Fiſtula; for ſuch a thing will be moſt like a Fiſtula, being full of holes here and there; all theſe may be cauſed by a crack of a bone, the marrow of the bone preſſing thorough, turning to a ſwelling, is ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down: Such examples I have ſeen many; unto which a belly flux is incident, or humours gather that way from the body, which increaſeth the diſeaſe of the Patient, whereof in the end he miſerably dieth.</p>
                     <p>If I know a bone to be broken, and the marrow of it is hardly to be diſperſed or driven back, then I do not dreſs it as a Fracture, but make an inciſion, like to a Flap-fracture, in the place where the Fracture and redneſs is, and dreſs it round like a Fracture-wound, and laid a ſplinter to the place where no redneſs was, held him quiet ſo long till the Fracture was ſore, and was fiery, appearing like a ſwelling, and coming to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106818:108"/> maturity, I dreſt him then to the bone very carefully, and left the band ſo, that the marrow might not preſs thorough and ſink downward. It laid a long time before it came to any corruption: I applied a plaiſter to the raiſed red place, like a Diachylon, guarding it round, that it could not preſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, but onely in that place where it ſhould break.</p>
                     <p>However I adviſe no man to do ſo; at the dreſſing of ſuch a one, have a care that the plaiſter go not quite round the Leg, and let your roulers be big and ſtrong, for if you ſuffer the place to raiſe and ſwell, the whole Joynt will be exulcerated and inflamed, and if you let it ſwell of its own accord, the whole Member will ſwell. And bind it not too hard; if it hath no vent at all, nor the plaiſter yeilds, then you muſt fear a ſuffocation of the Member, and the Patients health lies at ſtake.</p>
                     <p>Here I muſt tell ye, that ſome Patients will not have they ſhould be touched with any Iron, but rather will lie longer by, than be haſtily cured.</p>
                     <p>If you intend to make uſe of a Lenitife, apply it gently and bind it ſlack, <hi>viz.</hi> a Diachylon, or a Melilot Plaiſter, or any ſuch like to keep the ſore from further ulceration; when it maketh ſhew to break, let it have time enough, and open it not too haſtily, for the ſinew water is commonly at hand, and runs forth, not like corruption, but like bloud and water, which is a good ſign; if a white matter comes forth, then is it a ſign of putrefaction and ſeparation of the bone; if bloud and water comes out of it, then there is no putrefaction, ſuch a party muſt be kept in a band, like as a Flap-fracture is kept, which muſt not ſtir, it will be ſofter at the ſwelling then it would at an ulceration. Therefore dreſs that party like as a Flap-fracture is dreſt, and apply a freſh Fracture-plaiſter, and leave an open place, that he may be dreſt twice or thrice a day, let the corruption not run under the plaiſter to make it ſtink. When the Fracture is opened the Member unſwels, if the matter runs out, then the band will ſlacken, and the ſplinters will hold no more, and then you muſt renew your bands, and the ſplinters ſet right again.</p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106818:109"/>
                     <p> Leave room for the red place which inclineth to ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let the place not be covered with the plaiſter, that you may come at it when you intend to dreſs him; do not bind that place, leaſt you drive the matter back with the Lenitife you apply to; and in caſe you ſhould bind that place hard, you muſt fear that corruption will ſeek for another way to break thorough; if you make an inciſion, then do it in that place where the Patient is moſt pained, for under that place the Fracture lieth hid; take notice of the ſign where it is, ſtrike with your finger up and down, to ſee whether you can feel any crack, ſtirring or crookedneſs, hollowneſs or raiſing, if you find none of theſe, then take notice of theſe tokens, <hi>viz.</hi> the pains when the place is touched, is hard and red, and a raiſing is there, and the Patient complaineth that it is in a continual rage, and there is no where any ſwelling but in that place; for if there be a ſwelling in any other place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, then is it a ſign, that the bone and panicle is putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and eaten thorough, if theſe three ſigns be together (the redneſs being the chiefeſt) and they may be felt with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then is it certain, that there is a crack of the bone there and no where elſe; and here you are ſure of the token where you muſt open it. And that you may not looſe again that place, then mark it with a ſmall coal, or chalk, or oaker, or with a drop of oyl. At this time bind him not with roulers, tapes or fillettings, before you be provided with the Lancet, and a Plaiſter to apply it to the hole, Tents, Ointments, Sponge, Water, Ciſers and Spatule, &amp;c. make firſt two or three Tents one bigger than the other, to have your choice.</p>
                     <p>Being provided thus with neceſſaries, then take a long rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and bind his Leg or Arm, &amp;c. croſs way, cover not with the rouler the marked raiſing, pull the rouler ſtrongly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preſſing down the veins and ſinews, that the red marked place may raiſe the better; make that place raiſe high where you intend to make the inciſion, then you may be ſure that the matter will diſperſe it ſelf no whether elſe, and your inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be made the ſurer, you need not fear to hit an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right place, nor the Patient ſhrink under you; the inciſion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106818:109"/> will cauſe no great pain if bound hard, which would not be ſo if tied ſlack.</p>
                     <p>I tied many times on the roulers two fillettins, one above, the other below, fearing the marrow would ſlip away. Be not timorous in the inciſion, becauſe there is no danger in it, neither in the bleeding in caſe you ſhould hit a vein. For when I hit a vein in ſuch a caſe, I let it bleed but a little and ſtopped it again, neither is it any ſmall advantage, for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good breathing to the Patient, the Leg groweth the lighter, and the pains are leſſened. Sometimes ſuch an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cannot be made without the hitting of a vein, eſpecially below the Knee, unleſs the veins be rotten, having no bloud but matter in them.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak of ſuch, where neither corruption nor ulceration is, but of freſh skin and fleſh, and where a redneſs is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; you muſt make the inciſion upon the redneſs, if you will open it right, elſe the inciſion will be in vain.</p>
                     <p>When I held the Patient thus, and marked the higheſt place of the redneſs, then I took a ſtrong Lancet, laid it on cloſe to the place where it held hard againſt, thruſting it deeply into the crack, turning the Lancet a little in my hand, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſhould fall the bigger till to the Fracture or crack; if you do not ſo, then the inciſion will ſoon cloſe, no other, as when a hole is made with a bodkin into a four doubled cloath, where hardly a tent may be thruſted into; therefore have a care that the inciſion cloſe not, let it bleed well; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done bleeding, then apply to it Cotton wool or Mulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puffe on the tent, with a clinging plaiſter; you may allay the bleeding with a wet Sponge; if you think the panicle is not cut thorough, then make a ſtrong tent well turned, cover it with a ſharp Unguent, thruſt it in, that the panicle may be toucht with it, that tent will make vent enough, you need not to apply any Corroſive, and it will heal like a freſh Wound. Sometimes thinking that I had not hit it right, yet I took a board tent, which might beſt go into the Wound, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> ſtraying ſome burnt Allom upon it to keep open the inciſion and to make it wider; if you do
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106818:110"/> ſo, then you cauſe no long continuing pains, it keeps open the Wound if you put it in looſe.</p>
                     <p>Having given him a little reſt, and no bloud comes out, not ſo much as to ſtain the cloath, then you may dreſs him with a Fracture band, leave the Wound open, that you may come at it without any ſtirring, like a thorough Fracture or Flap-fracture. Dreſs him ſo as is ſaid, then you need not ſo many plaiſters, roulers, nor ſplinters, nor ſo much toils. That Wound muſt not be ſo ſcoured, as uſually they deal with a Flap-fracture, onely let the Wound have vent, and let it ſtand free. Apply the Plaiſter to it, that no air get into, and prevent putrefaction therein, that it run not betwixt the band; the Patient muſt not lie ſtill as he doth at a Flap-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, neither ought he to ſtay ſo long at it; if you can dreſs well ſuch a cracked bone, it will be a great advantage to you in dreſſing other Flap-fractures, and will be a great help un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>

You muſt take theſe things into ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this third Part, I will Inform you in the beſt and moſt <note place="margin">Knowledg of Symtoms is neceſſary.</note> faithful way of Symptoms, befalling the wounded, and the wounds, which is one of the chiefeſt points belonging to Surgerie; for without the knowledge of Symptoms in wounds little good can be effected, nay irrecoverable hurts are cauſed if Surgeons are ignorant of them, as woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teſtifieth. And in my opinion thoſe are no Surgeons which have no judgement in theſe Symptoms: for wounds healed, not according to the fundamentals of the Art, falls out accidentally, which good luck old women may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and ſome Matrones there are found which would be too
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106818:112"/> hard for ſuch Surgeons. Theſe I count for good Surgeons, which have a ſound judgement not of Symptoms that are at hand already, but ſuch that diſcern by infallible ſignes there comming: for theſe Symptoms have alwayes there forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which foretell of their comming. There is nere a raine without clouds, thundrings and lightnings accompany each other, and great cold bringeth froſt. Man is taken from earth, and hath the qualities of earth about him. Earth is the mother of all fruits, yet hath it many miſcreance: of the ſame condition is Man, for which cauſe Antiquity put the title of Microcoſme upon him. For Man being wounded, is no more in his right tune, is like a mother of all diſeaſes, which before there breaking in, appear in ſome tokens, which tokens a Surgeon ought to know, if he intends to do good and get credit. It deſerveth more praiſe to prevent an enemies invaſion, and is ſooner oppoſed then, then when his armie is come into a land to be expel'd. A Surgeon hath the more cauſe to be knowing in ſuch Symptoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſuch a variety of them, which to rehearſe is impoſſible. If men in health are ſubject unto Symptoms, what ſhall we ſay of wounded men? there are ſome held for ſound, in whom many infirmities lie hid; who being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fall into the wounds, cauſing ſome fiſtula's, cankers, or the like; which without a true proceſs are hardly cured well, and Surgeons may eaſily be deceived herein, if not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in thoſe wayes. Situations of dwelling places either further or hinder ſuch Symptoms, foggy places are not ſo wholeſome, as thoſe of a clear and pure aire. And the ſame cauſe it is with the yeares ſeaſons; as alſo the weapons are of different natures, whereby a wound is made; ſome are poyſonous, others are not, the former cauſe more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Symptoms than the latter, and one part of the body is more ſubject unto Symptoms than the other; and ſo are men alſo according to their ſeveral complections. Some patients cauſe Symptoms upon themſelves with their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly courſe of life; from thence ſeveral Symptoms within and without are cauſed, which a good Surgeon ought to know, elſe he will have but ill ſucceſs in his curing of wounds.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106818:112"/>
               <p> Theſe have been the ſtronger motive unto me, to write of the Symptoms in wounds, becauſe that knowledge lyeth hid deeply, whoſe names ſcarcely are known; whoſe true knowledge is very neceſſary; without which little good can be done: of theſe I will ſpeak in brief, and plainly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fundamentally and really, not having borrowed it from others, but as I found them true experimentally: my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to write of mine own, and leave others to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and it is fit every bird ſhould wear his own feathers.

                  <p>COurteous Reader, before I come to ſpeak in particular of Symptoms, I will firſt rehearſe ſome tokens in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, whereby Simptoms may be known: hoping you will be thereby enabled to conceive the better of them, if you hear every Simptoms ſigne deſcribed in particular.</p>
                  <p>He that is wounded at the Dura &amp; pia Mater, looketh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: <note place="margin">Signes of a wounded Brain.</note> when he beginneth to draw his mouth together, then it is a figne that there is a cramp in the wound: but if he ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with his eyes, it is a figne of an Apoplexie, and of death: if none of theſe ſignes are preſent, and the patient is hot, and his face is red, it ſignifieth a Feaver, or a diſeaſe of the wound is like to befall him. But if all the ſaid ſignes be at hand, then nothing ſo ſure as death. But if the patient <note place="margin">Wound-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</note> is beſides theſe in a rage and furie, then is he in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: again if the patient looks pale in his face, and is ſtill and quiet then is he in the better condition. If a patient ſtill thinks that ſome body gapeth into his wound, after he is <note place="margin">A pulling wound.</note> dreſt, it ſignifieth a Cramp, unleſs the Surgeon have put too much of the reſigne, which runneth like Turpentine, or any other Gum of that nature, whereby he cauſeth that pulling or griping.</p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:106818:113"/>
                  <p> If a wound be in a flame when dreſt, it ſignifieth that a <note place="margin">A burning wound.</note> ſharp humor is faln into it, which eateth of the fleſh already healed; unleſs the Surgeon have put too many hot hearbs to his Salve, or hath put to it too much of Maſtick, or gum Sarcocollae.</p>
                  <p>If a wound ſwelleth on the outer member, and paineth the patient very much at the changing of the weather, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <note place="margin">A wound ſenſible of weathers.</note> a withering and conſuming of the member, delay no time to help it, for if you ſhould ſtay till the wound be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, afterward you will hardly bring that hurt to right. A true Surgeon muſt underſtand and know aforehand, and help before the hurt be done; let him make uſe of exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting medicaments.</p>
                  <p>If there be a ſwelling in an outward joint or member, near the wound, and is yet hard, and doth not pain the party, <note place="margin">Swellings without pain.</note> and that wound healeth together from within, then is it a ſign that the medicaments are nought, and will do no good; though the wound be not unto lameneſs, yet in this manner it will be made lame, if the Surgeon goeth on in his applyed medicines: if he perceiveth it, then let him take better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicine: <hi>

                  <p>If a wound ſwelleth on an outward member, and doth <note place="margin">Signe of a Fſtula.</note> not pain the party when touched, and cloſeth, and the more it cloſeth the more it ſwelleth, it is a ſign that a fiſtula grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on: if it pricketh much being felt and toucht, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that a ſplinter of the bone would fain get out; but if it doth not prick, and ſeemeth to the patient as if he were toucht with an Iron, it is a ſign that a piece of an affthruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bloud-vein would fain get out, and the Surgeon ought to make vent: but in caſe the ſwelling paineth the party ſometimes, and at other times it doth not, at one time it is red, at another it is pale, it is a ſign that a Cancer will come <note place="margin">Signe of a Cancer.</note> into the wound: if it doth gnaw a little and doth prick when it is not toucht, and looks brown-red, then is it a ſign there is a Cancer in it already.</p>
                  <p>A wound that yeilded much matter at firſt, and the party
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106818:113"/> being well, but afterward the wound begins to water, (I <note place="margin">Water in a wound.</note> do not ſpeak here of the joint water) it is a ſure ſign that either a Cancer or a Fiſtula is coming; but if the patient groweth dayly weaker, it ſignifieth death.</p>
                  <p>If a wound inclineth to heal very faſt, and yet the party <note place="margin">Haſty heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of wounds.</note> groweth daily weaker, it is a ſure ſign of death: ſuch wounds are commonly purple-brown, ſhrink commonly, and it is an unnatural healing.</p>
                  <p>When wounded men are continually in a fright, it is an ill ſign, if a tucking pulling be accompanied with it, it is a <note place="margin">Frights in patients.</note> ſign that a wound-diſeaſe is coming; and if any redneſs be joined with it, it is a ſign that the wound-diſeaſe is already <note place="margin">Wound-diſeaſe: Suddain pains.</note> at the door. If ſuddain pains come into a wound, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away ſuddainly, and the party can after it not ſtir the joint, it ſignifieth that the Palſie is come into: of that joint you may ſay that it will keep lame, if no worſe thing come unto, which is to be feared.</p>
                  <p>If a Joint wound ſwelleth, and the joint water runs ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Joint water join'd with a ſwelling.</note> and the more, the more it ſwelleth; it is a ſign that the Surgeons medicines are not proper for it: therefore let him uſe better, in caſe he intends not to ſpoil the joint quite and by too much running it coſt the patients life; let him learn to make better Salves than he hath in his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>

                  <p>A wound made into the body, and prickings are in the ſide, ſignifieth death, if ſo be the wound is in that place.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106818:114"/> which ſet the healing backward, for ſuch ſlovens are found, which care not whether their medicines be made clean or no; and that fault is committed in medicaments that are both for inward and outward uſe. If a cough is incident, which <note place="margin">Cough a ſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed bloud.</note> is not canſed by the lungs, it is a ſign of congealed bloud in the body, if he brings up any bloud with his cough, then is it the ſurer ſign of it; but if that bloud brought up by cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is red and freſh, then is it a ſign that a bloud vein is wounded, which is ſtill a bleeding.</p>

                  <p>Touching Sleep; ſound peoples ſleep is not alike, ſome ſnoar in their ſleep, others without a noiſe, in theſe it matters not much: but it is another matter with thoſe that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe Surgeons ought to take notice of ſuch ſignes

                  <p>If a wounded party awakneth, knoweth not where he is and talks idely, it is a ſign that he is in a great heat, which ſoon will cauſe a diſeaſe in the wound.</p>

                  <p>A patient that ſleepeth much, and is idle withal in his ſleep, is hot in his body, yet ſweats not, it is a ſign that the wound diſeaſe is predominant: for ſuch there is no remedy, and dyeth: but if he ſweateh all the body over, then there is better hopes of him, but if he ſweateh onely on his breſt, it is a deadly ſign.</p>

                  <p>Surgeons muſt be careful at the dreſſings of Wounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome medicines are ſooner conſumed by Wounds, than others: if a Wound be haſtily dreſt, before the medicine hath done its work, then the Wound is robb'd of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines

                  <p>A Wound which brings not forth the matter duly, and more pains are cauſed thereby, it is a ſign, that an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Cold fire is coming, if he doth not prevent it.

                  <p>A Wound that looks well to the eye, and no great defect ſeen, yet the Patient at the ſeveral dreſſings groweth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, it intimates the naughtineſs of the medicine.</p>
                  <p>A party wounded in the head, and the Temple veins are <note place="margin">Temples that prick.</note> full, and feeleth pricking in them, it is a ſign that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is kept too warm.

                  <p>Theſe are the Signs, I thought good to inform you of, more could have been quoted: but hoping you will judge by theſe of the reſt, I let it ſo reſt, and onely one more I will tell you: In caſe there be pains in a Wound, where the veins, ſinews, tendons, &amp;c. are wounded, to remedy theſe, proceed in the following manner. A ſinew wounded onely, is more pained, than if quite cut aſunder: Reaſons of it are known, if you find that there is great pain in a Wound, by reaſon of the wounded white veins, then in the firſt place, apply a defenſive Plaiſter (of the which you ſhall find more in the Book of decoctions, or of coockery) and put into the Wound red oyl of Terpentine, or diſtilled oyl of Bayes or of Tyles, for theſe hot oyles aſſwage the pain in the ſinews, are pleaſing to them, and cold things are hurtful unto them: and the ſaid oyles are very penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with their heat: when ye put any of the ſaid oyles into the Wound, then dip a linnen piece of cloth in it, lie it to the vvound, and apply upon it a ſtiptick plaiſter. The pain being aſſwaged, and you will dreſſe the Wound again, then let the brown wound oyntment run into, and you may mingle a drop or two of the ſaid oyles with it, the pain will the ſooner ceaſe, and you fear the leſs the Joynt water.</p>
                  <p>I will teath you here to make a Wound Unguent, which <note place="margin">A good Unguent.</note> is good to take away not onely the pains of the ſinews, but is good alſo againſt the Cramp and other things. ℞ the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106818:116"/> clear and ſweet oyl of Amber, diſtilled with water <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led oyl of Bayes <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1 ſs, of unguentum <hi>dialthaeae</hi> ℥ 4 mingle theſe uſe in and about the Wound, and annoint the whole joynt and member with it and you will get credit by it. If there be great pains in the wound, and the joint water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth alſo, then proceed in that cure, as you heard in the Chapter, touching the joint water.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly note alſo, that when a Patient is vehemently pained in his Wound, and the pains will not ceaſe, and the Patient be not troubled with any other diſeaſe, then miniſter unto him in Wine or Water the conſerve <hi>Anodynum,</hi> from 6. to 8. or 9. grains, and ſo let the Patient reſt: in his ſleep all pains will ceaſe, be they never ſo vehement: and let the Wound nevertheleſs be dreſt according to Art. Thus much of pains in Wounds: he that knowes more and better waies, it is free for him to do well for the publick good, and not hide his Candle under a Buſhel.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>COrruption is the excrement of Wounds: every wound mattererh, and deſireth to make a ſeparation of that <note place="margin">What Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is.</note> which is deſtroyed, and to clear the impure from the pure, and to caſt away that which is nought, that the good part may not be infected and hindred. Nature beginning thus to work then appeareth the matter.</p>
                  <p>Corruption comes partly from the Wound, which ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to cleanſe it ſelf, partly from the medicine, and the <note place="margin">From whence it comes?</note> food, uſed to the Wound, and the matter is ordered that way: for a Wound if onely cleanſed, and nothing elſe uſed to it, it will afford ſome matter, which mans natural Balſam caſts forth at the Wound, which ſtriveth to heal it: if a proper medicine be uſed, pleaſant to the Balſam, then the Wound is fed by that medicine, caſting away the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106818:117"/> thereof, and is ſtrengthned thereby the better to attain unto a healing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if a proper medicine be applyed to the Wound, then it caſts forth the matter the better, in ſuch a manner <note place="margin">Good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine maks good Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> as it ought to be. But if the medicine be contrary unto the natural Balſam, then the wound cannot digeſt it well, and the matter alſo comes ſhort in its form and ſent: if ſo, then that medicine is nought, and a better is to be applyed: for the matter is altered according to the medicines goodneſs. Therefore learn to know the Matter, that you may be ſure whether its form be from the wound or no, or from any other Symptom, or whether the medicine cauſeth it to be of ſuch a ſhape.</p>
                  <p>Surgeons ought to know, that every wound affords Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be it much or little, and the one Matter doth not look like the other. Fleſh and blood have their ſingular matter: <note place="margin">A twofold Matter.</note> the white veins have their proper matter: and another matter affords the bones: the ſame muſt be underſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the internal members. Bones at there healing yeild a white ſlime and ſomewhat thick: but if they are not in a right tune, they give a clear water, without any ſmell, and looks greaſie; which is ſeen by the linnen that are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. White veins afford a clear water, ſomewhat tuff and ſlimie: but if they be out of order, then the water runs out yellowiſh abundantly, and tuff like the white of an Egg, or raw indigeſted blood.</p>
                  <p>Fleſh affords its matter ſomewhat thick, white gray, or of a carnation colour, with its due ſent, and willingly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth from the wound.</p>
                  <p>If the matter be tuff, clinging to the Wound, and muſt be forcibly taken off, and is cloddy, it is a ſign that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Full and cloddy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> decayeth in ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>And when there appeare any ſtreaks therein, it intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the ſinevvs are going, all haſtneth tovvard death. And if the original be not toucht and found, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help nor hope for to recover ſuch a party.</p>
                  <p>If the matter be tuff, ſticking to the vvound, then is the vvound in no good caſe, and inclineth to turn to another
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106818:117"/> Symptome, as to a Gangrene, Cancer, Fiſtula, and the like.</p>
                  <p>If the matter be thin, looks white like milk, it ſignifieth naughty blood, and the marrow in the bone is conſumed: <note place="margin">Thin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> if this matter comes in any quantity, then it is yet joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and intimateth a terrible Symptom, like to a palſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which you muſt look well, that the wound be kept dry, and no greaſineſs come into; elſe it will befall you as you heard about the wounds in the back bone.</p>
                  <p>If there be but little matter, the wound ſinks, and turns blew, and haſtily ſhutteh, it ſignifieth death, no help <note place="margin">Little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> for it.</p>
                  <p>But if the matter be thick and yellow, runs abundantly out of the wound if onely ſquezed a little; it intimateth a <note place="margin">thick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> great hollowneſs: and if that wound be bone-chattar'd, then it is a ſign, that a looſe bone would fain break out. If ſuch a party come to your cure, then tarry not, but begin in time to cure it as a Fiſtula: if there be a ſmall bone at hand, it will come out nere the ſooner. That Patient muſt be put to the ſmalleſt, and not to the greateſt cure.</p>
                  <p>If a Wound that is ſoft, being ſquezed, yeilds a foam or <note place="margin">A froth in the wound.</note> froth mingled with blood, it intimates a ſpongie fleſh in the wound, and it will turn to a Fiſtula: therefore cure it as a Fiſtula; that ſoft fleſh will ſoon ſettle to a better ground-work of the cure. A wound that beareth no matter, is at a ſtand, it intimates that an Inflamation is coming into, whoſe <note place="margin">Wound without matter.</note> forerunner is Prunella.</p>
                  <p>Stinking corruption in wounds prognoſtick ill. Here the Surgeon muſt well know the matter, and to judge by the <note place="margin">Stinking matter.</note> form, ſent, coluor, &amp;c. how his Patient muſt be cured.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of corruptions in wounds, more could be ſpoken of in that particular, ſhuning prolixity, I let it reſt ſo: neither is it well poſſible to write more exactly of it: for every matters form is a working to the applyed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, every Surgeon uſeth his own medicines; which is the reaſon why theſe ſignes differ ſo much. The ſignes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned here, are ſet upon mine own Wound Ointments, ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Plaiſters: thoſe that uſe other things, muſt find other ſignes.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:106818:118"/>
                  <p> Surgeons ought to know their medicines, and obſerve their operations, chiefly how they appear in the making of the matter, then may they judge what medicines are good, and which are nought for the wounds they have in hand.</p>

                  <p>THe Symptoms of the Joint water are ſo well known, that I believe it a thing ſuperfluous, that I ſhould write <note place="margin">Joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> of it. However confidering that the Symptoms herein ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Surgeons more than all others, therefore I could not forbear.

                  <p>Note this about the Joint water, there is a moiſture in joints, called by Surgeons a Gluten, becauſe it maketh the <note place="margin">Joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is no gluten.</note> joints ſlibberie, without which no joint is in its right tune: this moiſture is but little in quantity. Some Surgeons ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the joint water is that which lyeth in the joint: theſe are miſtaken, and deceave others to their great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. For ſometimes there runs out of one wound more joint water than there is of the Gluten in mans body: and when that Gluten hath done running in that joint, then that joint withereth, and is no more flexible. No art can reſtore that gluten, if once gone and loſt. For the joint water, called <hi>Synonia,</hi> which uſually runs out at the wound, is properly a moiſture of ſinews and veins, whereby every joint receiveth its ſtrength, without which no joint can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. <note place="margin">What is joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> For if in a wound the ſinews, tendons, muſcles, &amp;c. be hurt, then they let their moiſture go, which runs out at the wound; and is then called the joint water, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth running ſo long, till the ſinew is fed by the digeſtion, then it begins by degrees to ceaſe, and the wound inclineth unto healing.</p>

                  <p> If a wound be hindred in its healing by the running of the joint <note place="margin">the ioint water is hurtful to the whole body.</note> water, becauſe it was not dreſt with proper medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the joint water getting its full courſe, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave all the parts of the body of their natural moiſture or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical humidity, and cauſe them to dye. For the joint water getting the praedominancie, and runs too long, then that joint falls into an irrecoverable Conſumption, whithereth quite away, as being wholly bereaved of its food. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Salt ſpirit by the joint water.</note> ſome times, that the joint water is accompanied with a ſalt ſpirit, corroding the ſinewes, bringing them into putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, whereby great holes and pains are cauſed. I have met with ſuch a party, who was hurt in his finger: his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon could not allay the joint water, becauſe the ſinewes were corroded and eaten, whereby holes got into the hand, and from thence even to the elbow, pieces of putrified ſinews were taken out. This joint water his Surgeon could not ſtay, it run up into the arm further, and came into the ſhoulder, the party dyed miſerably of it. Here let Sugeons take notice, not to ſet ſo ſlieght by the joint water, and to ſtay it in time, how that may be done you ſhall hear.</p>
                  <p>An expert Surgeon muſt not be terrified by the joint water, becauſe it is the excrement of ſinews and white veins: let him endeavour to ſtay it with proper medicines, which if right and good, they will ſtay it within five dayes: and the running of it is chiefly cauſed by improper medicines applyed, and by the patients diſorderly life.</p>
                  <p>Note, the joint water cannot be reduced to a corruption, which among ignorant Surgeons hath begotten that fowle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, which they commit in the ſtaying of it, and is ſtill in practiſe: for they ſuppoſe, that it can be ſtayed with exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things, therefore they uſed <hi>Terra ſigillata, Bolus, calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Shells, bones of Pickrels, Egg ſhells, of new hatched Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, vinegar of Sloes, &amp;c.</hi> ſome (being taught by the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) burnt <hi>Cotton wool,</hi> and thurſt it thus burning into the wound, ſome uſe <hi>Cantharides;</hi> whereby they make it known, that they never knew what joint water meaneth: elſe they would never go ſo dreamingly about ſo weighty a matter. I muſt confeſs, that the manuall is of as great conſequence as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106818:119"/> Receipt may be. I reject none of the means, which they have learned; becauſe the vehement courſe of the joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requireth ſometimes ſuch haſty ſtenching. But if ſuch wounds be dreſt in the way I told you of, the joint vvater needs not to be feared. To ſtay the joint water, you may beſt conceive by theſe examples in what manner it is done: <note place="margin">Examples.</note> A Carpenter hurt himſelf againſt a piece of Timber: I know not in what manner he was dreſt at firſt, the joint water run out abundantly at the wound, and about the wound many holes fell in, which the Barbar Surgeon dreſt alwaies with tents, and in his thinking he had done well. But the extraodinary pains grew ſo much on the patient, that he was fain to change his Surgeon. becauſe he ſaw that things grew worſe with him: and he ſent for me, whom with good ſucceſs upon Gods bleſſing I dreſt and cured thus. I warm'd my brown ointment, let it run into all the places of the wound, filled them up therewith: afterward I dreſt him vvith ſtiptick Plaiſter, after the manner of an Opodeldoch, that nothing may run out of the vvound, this I iterated three times a day: I kept the vvound vvarm alſo, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed a defenſive plaiſter. This continuing a vvhile, the joint vvater vvas ſtayed; after that I vvent to healing, and proceeded ſuccesfully in the cure.</p>
                  <p>Note this Maſter piece, accompanied vvith much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: <note place="margin">the brown Ointment a true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-plece.</note> if you think the depth of the vvound be ſuch; that the bottom of it cannot be fill'd out every where vvith the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then take my brown ointment, boyle it to ſuch a ſpiſſitude, that you may make tents of it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hurſt it to the bottom of the vvound, cover it vvell, that nothing of it get out again, apply a ſtiptick Plaiſter to it: the inthruſt tent vvill melt in the vvound, joyne vvith the joint vvater, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling it back, and vvill ſtay it more than any other oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of greaſie things: for the joint water being hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, receiveth not eaſily any greaſie thing, but expels it vvithout any operation done. But that brovvn ointment, made of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is not greaſie, and eaſily uniteh with the joint vvater: and being ſharp, conſumeth the tuffneſs in the humidity, and vvorketh more effectually.</p>

                  <p> This is the mean and plain way whereby I ſtay the joint water, making uſe of no other means, in caſe no other Symptomes came into, This is the reaſon, why I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſo often this brown Ointment to be uſed againſt the joint water, and other Symptomes.

                     </gap> miſſe in their cures. I have ſeen Surgeons, though they had good judgement in joint water, yet ſuch incident hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors put them to great perplexity.</p>
                  <p>The joint water comes from white veins or ſinewes, and hath its colour, as it is known: if other ſharp humors are <note place="margin">Colour of joint-water, what it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.</note> joined with it, then it looſeth its own colour, inclining to a whay-colour, and is tuff like the white of an Egg: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uddy or fleſh coluor: ſometimes it looks like oyle tinging the ravelings of linnen about the tents.</p>
                  <p>It is known by experience, that the white colour of it brings the greateſt danger, commonly cauſing a Palſie to that member, and the other humor joined with it hath its cauſe from the head. The red matter which holdeth long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt here, intimateth a humor falling from the liver, milt, and reins. The yellow water, which cauſeth the greateſt pains, comes from the yellow Jaundice, or from the gall
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106818:120"/> If a Surgeon is about the ſtaying of ſuch a joint water, and another humor be joined with it, it is hardly repelled or ſtayed, as long as theſe humors are joining with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Surgeons muſt endeavour to prepare their medicines <note place="margin">Note the cure of the joint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> accordingly; that thoſe humors coincident with the other may be taken away: ſuppoſe the humor come from the head, then the medicine muſt be Cephalical, and ſo with the reſt muſt be proceeded.</p>
                  <p>The manner of this cure is thus: If a humor accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth <note place="margin">white.</note> the joint water, which came from the head, then this ſubſequent remedy, I found to be beſt for the party. <hi>Viz.</hi> The fume of Storax Calamintha mingled with ſome Amber, which the party took down at his mouth going to bed, in a funible or pipe. This may be uſed two or three dayes, then look whether it do ſtay that white water, if not, then uſe it once more, to cleanſe the head the better of that white humor; for that fume is very proper for the head: <hi>item</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecifica proper for the head may be uſed. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim let the wound be dreſſed as it ought, with the brown Ointment, wound-Ointments, ſtiptick Plaiſters, applyed in the manner of an Opodeldoch, or the Opodeldoch it ſelf to be uſed. Let the Patients dyet be anſwerable to the heads infirmities. It is fit that a contrary vein to the wound be breathed, as the parties condition requireth. If the <note place="margin">Red joint mater.</note> joint water runs of a ruddy colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then uſe Diureticks, to open the obſtructions of the Liver, and Milt, <hi>Viz.</hi> Anniſe, Fennel, Maidenhair, Tamarisks, winter Cherries, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Liverwort, &amp;c. Of theſe you may make a drink for the Patient, and go on in the applying of external medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſo long till this red colour is changed. <note place="margin">Yellow joint water.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The yellow joint water burneth exceedingly, uſually ſpoyleth the wound; and this is incident to ſuch parties, that are ſubject or troubled with the yellow Jaundice, and is known by theſe ſignes: The parties looks yellowiſh in and about the Eyes, the Breaſt, where that diſeaſe begins and ſends it further to other parts; and the party then fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſome eaſe about the heart and ſtomack. Such a party muſt be ſpedily lookt to, before this hot humor eateth off
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106818:120"/> the veins and ſinews, and bring him unto deaths door, if the party be not holp, the wound will farre the worſe. Therefore delay no time in diverting theſe humors, and expel them by ſtool. For theſe parties are good ſuch things, which uſually are miniſtred againſt the yellow Jaundice. Let the party obſtaine from Wine, but he may drink Barly water, wherein are boiled Raiſins, and Melons ſeed. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him alſo right in his dyet, uſe no ſour nor hot things, no Spice. Let him uſe much of Borage, Bugloſſe, Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Plantain, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This enſuing purge alſo may be uſed. ℞ of the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ℥ 3 of Rubarb <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 2 ſmall beaten; of Raiſins ℥ 2, of the beſt Prunes the number of twenty, of Roſe water ℥ 1 ſs. freſh well Water, and white Wine, ana lib. 1.</p>
                  <p>Boil theſe till the Prunes be enough, ad to it pulveriſed Cinnamon. The Patient is to eat every morning of theſe Prunes the number of ſix, and of the liquor he is to take cochl. 4: it will purge him gently, and expell the ſharp gall by ſtool.</p>
                  <p>This purge may be, will be too coſtly for poor people; let them take inſtead of Manna and Rubarb, of Polopodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ℥ 1. ſmall chopt and beaten, and of Rhapontick <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 3, and make the reſt as you heard. Theſe muſt be uſed, as long as theſe humors are apparent: theſe being gone, your medicaments are to ceaſe alſo, elſe too much moiſture will be drawn to the wound, which would prove obſtructive unto the healing of it. Touching outward things to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the wound, apply the brown Ointment, Wound-ointments, ſtiptict Plaiſters, &amp;c. as you heard above, which are uſed ſo long as any of theſe Symptomes are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

                  <p>THe things that I do write now, touching congealed Blood; have been told by thoſe which lived long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and found them very good for ſuch purpoſes: to their large writings I direct the Reader. I have made uſe of them, and found them to do very well, and durſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in them.</p>
                  <p>I mean not here congealed Blood which is in the head betwixt the ſcull and the skin; of theſe I have ſpoken enough above about Head-wounds.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak now of ſuch congealed Bloud, which lurketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other places of the body, cauſed by a blow, puſh, fall, ſtrain, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of this Bloud, inwardly ſuch congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bloud comes to the hollow body: outwardly it congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth between the skin and fleſh. Surgeons muſt be careful <note place="margin">Congealed blood is of two ſorts.</note> herein, to deal rationally; for ſuch parties come dayly to their hands, which by ignorant Surgeons are ſpoyled.</p>
                  <p>Touching congealed Bloud in the hollowneſs of the body. Note if it be there, then be ſure that a Feaver will be cauſed, <note place="margin">Blood in the hollow of the body.</note> and a mortal Impoſthumation. Therefore in the firſt place phlebotomize the party, obſerving the Patients condition, and the place. Jeſt not in theſe things, which concerne mans life; and adviſe with a good Phyſitian. Then uſe means, which are diuretick, diaphoretick, purgative and extenuating, that it may not turn to a Feaver, or mortal Impoſthume, or Ulceration. To this purpoſe are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, Rhubarb, Rhapontick, Maiden-hair, Fennel, and Anniſe ſeed, hearb and root, Parſley root: all manner of diureticals and aperitives of the liver, Here is uſed alſo Terra ſigillata, Bole armoniack, Ocula cancorum, Sperma cetae, prepared red Corals, calcined Harts horn, &amp;c. In ſuch caſes are uſed alſo ſome diſtilled waters, of Night-ſhade,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106818:121"/> Alkekengi, Caſſia, &amp;c. as Art and Experience ſhall ſupply you herein. There is Unguentum populeon, found in ſhops, which is very good againſt congealed Bloud within the body, mornings and evenings ℥ 1 taken in Wine, or the like vehicle.</p>
                  <p>You may uſe alſo this following Pouder: ℞ Sperma ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, <note place="margin">Powder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> ℥ ſs, Mumia, Terra ſigillata, Linch cakes, coales of the wood of Tamarisk, ana ℥ ſs, Polipodium the root of it, ℥ 1: pulveriſe all theſe, miniſter <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1 of it to the party, mornings, evenings, and at noons. This doubltleſs will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe and expel the congealed Bloud.</p>
                  <p>You may obſerve, when ever you intend to diſperſe and <note place="margin">Note.</note> to expel congealed Bloud within, then put a purgative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient among the reſt, as Folia ſenae, Rhubarb, Polipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp;c. Above there was ſet down ſome pectoral Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may ſerve for this purpoſe alſo, if you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Touching external congealed Bloud cauſed by falls, <note place="margin">Blood in Wounds.</note> throws, blowes, &amp;c. whereby the bloud burſt out of the veins and lurketh between the fleſh and skin, and appeareth with blew ſtreaks, in ſuch caſes my advice is this. Let the party be phlebotomiſed inſtantly, where you think it fitteſt; then apply a Plaiſter to the place where the bloud appeared; <hi>Viz.</hi> Emplaſtrum exiccans, of Terra ſigillata, Bole Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, Dragons bloud, Ceruſs, Pitch, Roſin, Amber, Calmey, Sloe-moſs, unripe ſloes, buttons and leavs of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Mirtles, &amp;c. out of theſe make a Plaiſter, called a Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and apply it in form of a Poulteſſe.</p>
                  <p>In this manner you may order your medicines, as you think good, obſerving the conditions of the party and place. I give you one inſtance: ℞ Bole armoniack ℥ 3, Chalk ℥ 1, evaporated exiccated juice of Sloes ℥ 1 pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe theſe and boil them in ſtrong Vinegar, ad to it ſome bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Walwort, and ſtir among it Oat meal or Millers duſt, make it thick like a Poulteſſe, ad ſome oil of Mirtles among it: the oil of Sloes were better: apply this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme wet to the place affected.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſpeak of ſome abuſe, which ſome Surgeons commit in ſuch caſes uſing greaſie things, to little purpoſe: <note place="margin">Abuſe.</note>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:106818:122"/> take heed of ſnotty greaſie Ointments, becauſe in ſuch caſes no moiſt but exiccating things are to be uſed. For all ſorts of Bloud, which forſook their natural places, as veins turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to water; and if there be no great quantity of ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bloud, it will be exiccated by natural applyed medicines and quite expelled. But if you uſe much of greaſie things, and many wet Cataplaſmes, as ſome Surgeons uſually do, it will not onely be to no purpoſe, but alſo cauſe perillous Symptomes: for ſuch applyed greaſie wet Poulteſſes force the congealed bloud to turn unto corruption. What wil that prove but a dangerous Impoſthumation, which after a long time in great pains breaks, if it falls out ſo well: ſometimes it turns to a Fiſtula, or other Ulcer: yea ſometimes ſuch anger is cauſed, that death enſueth upon.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of this: one thing more I add: a pulveriſe Potion may be uſed here alſo, it will haſten the healing and eaſe the Patient the ſooner.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THings ſpoken of in the precedent Chapter, touching congealed Bloud, are to be underſtood thus: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſuch parties that find themſelves well beſides the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are at of congealed bloud. In our language I know not whether any ſufficient information is extant touching this particular, and I think it not amiſs to give ſome hints of it.</p>
                  <p>If congealed Bloud in the body be left there ſo long, till <note place="margin">Congealed blood in the body.</note> it turn into matter, then the aforeſaid means will not help, as being too weak; Surgeons either out of careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or out of ignorance let their Symptomes run on: If in the ſide, back, breaſt, or a vein be broken, be it about the milt, liver, or any other part; and that ſprained or broken vein bled very much, but that bloud doth not run into the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106818:122"/> belly, but ſticks between fleſh and skin, and is nearer to the inſide than to the skin, and makes little ſhew at the outſide, and may be nearer the liver or milt, however it is betwixt the fleſh and the skin, and there it putrifieth and comes to ulceration: this will not be cured nor helped by purging, &amp;c. Reader underſtand it thus: if nature be oppreſt by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of bloud, or neglected by Surgeons, of theſe we intend not to ſpeak. For nature is able to expel it of her own ſtrength. The four outer parts of the body may be oppreſt with congealed bloud, cauſed by a fall, throw, &amp;c. if neglected or by Surgeons dawbing brought to ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: then the things ſpoken of in the precedent Chapter, avail nothing: therefore other medicaments muſt be had, of which I will give you a hint.</p>
                  <p>Note one thing, there is but one proceſs, be the hurt from what cauſe it will, either from the ſuperfluity of bloud, or the Patients careleſneſs, or the neglect of the Surgeon. I will be orderly in my inſtruction, and tell you the beſt way how to help congealed bloud in the body, which is turned into corruption: if the Impoſthume be not abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the body, but more to the outſide, and that befals the four outer parts of the body, either through the Patients or the Surgeons fault.</p>
                  <p>Then if that congealed bloud begins to putrifie, it may be <note place="margin">Signes of congealed blood.</note> known by ſignes; the Patient wil feel it at his ſide, whether it will come to any Impoſthume, &amp; he may know it alſo by the matter he brings up, whether in clots and ſtinking: if ſo, then that congealed bloud begins to putrifie.</p>
                  <p>Such a party muſt not be delayed, but ſpeedily be taken into cure; for delayes will make it run on to an Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume, which muſt break at laſt. If it comes to that, then the party is neglected, and the help will come too late: for Nature having once begun to caſt up that matter, then ſhe muſt be aided.</p>
                  <p>As I told you above, ſo I ſay ſtill: when theſe foreſaid ſignes are apparent, then the named remedies will availe nothing, becauſe the Impoſthumation is too ſturdy for them, and goes on in growing. For putrified bloud goeth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106818:123"/> ſlowly out of mans body, infecting other parts, as the lungs, liver, milt, &amp;c. Beſides a dangerous cough will be incident, which will breed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>miſchief, miſchief, therefore other means muſt be thought upon.</p>
                  <p>Tonching my medicine, I tell you thus: if congealed bloud be in the body, and that within the hollow of it, then uſe not Mercury, ſpoken of afterward; Diaphoreticks are to be uſed. But if the Wound was not into the hollow body, and none of the inward parts is hurt, then theſe things may be uſed which I will ſpeak of. If the caſe be ſuch, as was told now: then firſt make a gentle purging drink of ſirup of Roſes, to give the Patient two ſtools: the ſecond day miniſter to him in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs of ſuccus Roſarum 5, 6, 7, or 8 grains of the following prepared Mercury, ſtill regarding the Patients condition, and let him lye ſtill: when it begins to work, let the patient take ſome ſpoonfuls of broth, and two hours after he may eat a broth into which two yolks of Eggs are beaten, afterward let him take his reſt, and ſweat upon.</p>
                  <p>This Mercury may ſafely be uſed: if it fumeth up but once, and that very gently, according as he meets with an <note place="margin">Mercuries operation.</note> object above in the body: but it purgeth bravely by ſtool, carrying away the congealed bloud and other filth, though it had been an Impoſthume, it muſt go, with a gentle ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not ſo, as uſually precipitated Mercury doth.</p>
                  <p>If you are an Artiſt, you wil prepare this Mercury in my way: and you may prepare alſo ſomewhat of Antimony. But Vitrum Antimonij is nought here, by reaſon of its ſtrong vomiting quality: I tell you without Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations congealed bloud will not be eradicated out of the body, if turn'd to an Impoſthume. The next day after the miniſtration of this purge, phlebotomize the party: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, <note place="margin">Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</note> if the party cannot tell where his greateſt pain lyeth, then breath the Median of the right arm, or open the Liver vein on the right arm: if the party complaines of his left ſide, then open the Spleen vein on the left arm. This being <note place="margin">Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</note> done and the patient is not wel yet, as it fals out commonly, then take the precious red Balſam of Sulphur, (whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106818:123"/> you find above in the Chapter of breaſt Wounds) four or five drops of it, and ℥ 1 of the Aquavitae deſcribed in Wound-diſeaſes, mingle theſe, let the Patient drink it and ſweat upon. This Diaphoretick may be uſed twice or thrice, once a day, and ſo long till the party be eaſed of his pains. Thus you will do much good.</p>

Being it is ſo, why ſhould it be kept lock'd up there to prolong pains: beſides as you heard, it is ſure, that the blood which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from its natural place, turneth to matter: why ſhould it not be better then, to let that water run out of ſuch places, and the hurt may the ſooner be healed, to which rational men will condeſcend.</p>
                  <p>Reader, by theſe you may know, that lenitives are to be avoided here; <hi>Viz.</hi> Diachylon, or other Gums, and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſmes; for all ſoftning things are hurtful here: becauſe theſe Symptomes are of another condition, then other putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſwellings: thus much of theſe, touching the outer parts.</p>
                  <p>But if Symptomes are iucident to the ſide, belly, back, ſhoulder: with theſe you muſt proceed thus: here the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ought to take notice, whether after the fall, blow, &amp;c. the place did ſwell four or five dayes after, and whether any pains be joined with it, as pantings, beatings, pullings, and whether the party can fetch his breath eaſily and without pains, and whether he feel any great heat; it matters not of what colour the hurted place be.</p>
                  <p>If that ſwelling doth pain the party being toucht, and looks ruddy, then launce the place with any inſtrument, do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly, doubtleſs you will hit the congealed blood, then

                  <p>Formerly I condemned Cataplaſmes to be uſed, much more now do I forbid them. For there is no maturative of that vertue, as to do the feat here, to force the matter the ſooner to eat thorough the skin, but rather will make the matter eat inward, and if it eateth through, into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low body, then the party dyeth: and ſuppoſe that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in that kind, yet will they be unfit for work, and are crazy to their dying day.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen many neglected in this kind: I quote onely two examples for to inform you the better: the one ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how the party after launcing did well, and the other party, whoſe hurt was not launced, dyed miſerably.

                  <p>Another party being a Gentleman had a fall with his horſe, was ſhrewdly bruiſed on his left ſide; all manner of means were uſed but to no purpoſe: the party was much troubled with prickings and a cough, little ſign was ſeen neither ſwelling nor redneſs, and where the bloud ſhould be gathered, it could not be diſcern'd, Phyſitians, Surgeons, and my ſelf alſo were called; ſome would have it launced, but the major vote, was for the negative, what hapned? the third day after the blood and matter come out at his mouth, and not long after he dyed.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Wound which was thought to be well, beginning to bleed, then the following ſignes are to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. The Surgeon trying with his Seeker, finding ſome <note place="margin">What the bleeding in wounds meaneth.</note> bleeding, in a ſmall quantity, is not be troubled much at it, becauſe the ſound fleſh may be that ſearching be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleed. But if the bloud comes abundantly, then ſurely by that needleſs ſearching a bloud vein is hurt and turn'd out of its place, which cauſed ſuch vehement bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the wound not being hurt by that ſearching, yet bleedeth: it ſignifieth that ſome ſhatter'd ſplinter is looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which being deſirous to get out, ſticks in the new fleſh, and makes it bleed: this is beſt known to be ſo, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toucht at the wound, is mightily prickt, and that bloud be clear and freſh.</p>
                  <p>The manual to be uſed herein in this, to keep open that wound with a ſmall tent, which is to be covered with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum <note place="margin">What the Surgeon ought to do in this caſe.</note> Egiptiacum, and to dreſſe that wound but once a day, ſo that that looſe ſplinter may come nearer the mouth of the wound, and be pluckt out. And if it hangeth yet on a panicle, it muſt be let alone, till it looſneth of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. In that intrim ſearch not with the inſtrument in the wound, for fear that ſplinter be preſt into a ſinew, whereby great miſchief would be cauſed.</p>
                  <p>If a wound bleedeth abundantly, it is a ſign, that a bloud vein cloſing is opened again, in which caſe you muſt do thus. If the wound be yet wide open, then uſe an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bloud ſtencher, and put into it dayly the wound Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then it will ſoon overgrow with fleſh, and be ſtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of its own accord. And in caſe there be any bloud in the Wound, as it often hapneth, then that bloud muſt not be wiped or waſht out, which Surgeons ordinarily do, but leave it there, becauſe that ſtoppeth the bloud vein: and then the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106818:126"/> wound Ointment, and the ſtitch Plaiſter keeps off other hurtful things unto the Wound: and that bloud which ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wound, will ſoon come out in the ulcerating. But if the Wound be very narrow, then the caſe of it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for if it be very narrow, then make a tent prepared with a coroſive (that coroſive is it which lyeth ſettled, in the bottom of unguentum Egiptiacum,) and fill up the wound with it, ſo that no bloud may get out: this tent muſt not be put too deep into the wound, onely half way, leave it their for thirty hours, applying a Plaiſter to it. At the taking off the Plaiſter, the tent not ſticking to the Plaiſter, and goeth out eaſily, then let it ſtay there, and apply the Plaiſter again for ten hours longer, then open it, take out the tent, apply a ſmaller tent covered with the wound Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a ſtitch Plaiſter upon: and thus proceed to the end of that cure.</p>
                  <p>Squeeze no blood out of the Wound, becauſe the Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deldoch will do it without any other means: beware you <note place="margin">No blood to be ſqeez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the wound. Example.</note> do not ſearch in the wound with the ſeeker, for fear you do ſtir a bloud vein, and cauſe it to bleed afreſh. For I knew a Surgeon, who was ſtill graping with his inſtrument into the parties Wound, cauſing thereby a vehement bleeding, and ſpoyling the patient.</p>
                  <p>At a certain time a patient was brought to me, whoſe wound did bleed ſo much, that he grew very faint thereby. The Surgeons who had him firſt in hand, tryed ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, uſing long ſharp tents for the Wound, whereby they toucht the bloud vein, cauſing vehement bleeding, I took out the tent, flung it away, uſing none, and cured the party in ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>In ſome Wounds there is found much blood, yet none runs out at the opening or undreſſing of it, and no ſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth either of pricking or any other: this is a ſign, that that that Wound was tyed to hard, and the party is full of blood. For with hard binding the fleſh is preſt together, and is forced to cleanſing, and weeping: and if it hath vent, it bleeds no more. This Symptom is thus remedied, to bind the wound ſlackly, and let the party not put on too ſtraight clothes.</p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:106818:126"/>
                  <p> Surgeons ought to take good notice, and care, when the bleeding Wound will not be ſtenched, eſpecially when that Wound bleedeth not, but after when it is dreſt, or elſe it bleedeth before and after dreſſing, and at the dreſſing: the cauſe hereof is, that the veins at the dreſſing be too much forced and preſt; the ſame is ſeen at phlebotomiſing, when the veins are tyed too hard, the blood doth not ſpin out ſo freely: however pretty things help the bleeding of the vein. This ought to be known, at the bleeding of a Wound in the foot, to have it ſtenched. The dreſſing is of as great ſequel and concernment, as applyed medicines to Wounds, which I know experimentally.</p>
                  <p>If a parties Wound bleedeth, when he goeth or ſleepeth, then bind it ſlack, and meerly apply the Plaiſter, then you may the ſooner perceive from whence that bleeding comes, and take notice of the following ſign: for that is cauſed when there is no tent put in, elſe it is a falſe ſign. When a ſpongious fleſh appeareth out of the Wound, looking like coam'd wool, and that without any pain may be put in; this ſignifieth that a ſplinter is looſe, or a piece of arteries is coming forth: for ſuch a thing cloſeth nigh with the bloud vein, which is hurt with touching: here you muſt ſearch without delay, elſe the party and you will have work enough, becauſe the bleeding may be increaſed, and the vein be ſhut a great deal behind that, and no way left for you to come near it, and bring you to ſorrowes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſtrow onely burnt Allum into it, this is ſtrong enough; if you ſhould uſe a ſtronger, it would ſoon run and eat through the Wound, which in a long time you would hardly be able to cure again. Let the Allum lay there till the next day, it will come forth of its own accord: if not, then put more of the Allum to it, it will take away the fleſh which ſticketh to the ſplinter. But in caſe the fleſh and ſplinter will not part one from another, proceed you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in the cure, as if there were no ſuch ſplinter, it will looſen of its own accord in time, the healing will thruſt it off, and muſt give way, even as an old tooth muſt yeild to a new coming one: ſo that ſpongious fleſh driveth the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106818:127"/> ſplinter, that it may be taken forth at laſt without danger.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let not ſuch a Wound be cloſed, but keep it open till the ſplinter cometh forth, or the piece of the vein be gotten out with the matter: for a Wound cloſed up, where a piece of the vein is yet unhealed, it will cauſe ſhrewd Impoſthumes.</p>

But if the Wound is ſwelled, then it is a ſign, that a hollowneſs is left in the Wound: and if pantings, pains, and ſmarts are felt in it, then the ſurer is the ſign of ſuch a thing. This is incident to ſuch Wounds which were very deep, and were ſilily and ignorantly ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, to cloſe them the ſooner, before any fundamental healing was laid at the ſides, hence ſuch ſpoiled wounds are cauſed. If any ſuch neglected wound comes to your hands, &amp; you have obſerved by the ſigns, that there are no ſplinters in it, then do thus. Take our Opodeldoch, and the clear running reſine, ana ℥ 3, melt each apart on a gentle coal fire, and then pour them together, put to it pulveriſed am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ℥ ſs, ſtir it well together, till it be cold: ſpread a Plaiſter of it, in that bigneſs, that the whole ſore and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be covered with it, and apply it: let the plaiſter not run together, as you were informed of it, about the fractures:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106818:127"/> it will forcibly draw out the humidity through the skin, and heal the wound fundamentally. In caſe there lyeth matter beneath the Wound, then open it nere the ſooner. Theſe are called Wound Fiſtula, theſe have their cauſes from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Wound Fiſtula.</note> things, which are cauſed by evill medicines and ſilly Surgeons. They are comprehended under one cure, which you ſhall hear in its time, when I ſhall ſpeak of all manner of ſores.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind of Colloſities, different from the other, which are very hard, without pains, and appear on <note place="margin">Other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſities.</note> the joint with a ſwelling, do not pain the party if toucht, and go away again of their own accord, and the Wound looks fair, as if healed: this it a ſign, that there is ſome humor ſhut up there, which after the healing of the part or member doth appear on the joint, and there ſettleth in the hollowneſs of the joint: that gibhoſitie goeth away again, yet leaveth a humor behind. This moiſture being ſettled there, doth join with the gluten of the joint, and groweth tartareous in the end; being come ſo farre, then pains are cauſed afreſh, which ſtifneth and ſuffocateth the joint, that it cannot be flexible any more, which the party ar firſt could ſtir and move whileſt the Wound was freſh.</p>
                  <p>The Surgeon that had ſuch Wounds in cure, knoweth beſt what the cauſe thereof is, if he hath dreſt them with Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſmes, which never did any good to any joint Wound: becauſe moiſt things are alwaies hurtful to joint Wounds, and above you heard more largely of it: if the tendons in joints are wounded, and the wounds are ſtitched, then the moiſture which theſe ligaments afford cannot be well cleanſed out of the Wound, (for theſe afford no matter, as fleſh wounds do, though their moiſture be more clear and ſubtile, but is tuff and clinging,) ſo theſe ſettle betwixt the joint, where they keep ſo long till they get a little vent. This maketh no appearance, unleſs the Wound be cloſed. And ſeing it can not ripen to any matter, (no moiſture of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons turns to matter, as you heard) therefore needs muſt it turn to a colloſitie, cauſing that miſchief you heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Some Surgeons regard theſe infirmities but little, if
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106818:128"/> they have made up their cure, then they have a holy day.</p>
                  <p>Many Patients that were ſpoiled through ſtitching, were brought to me, whom through Gods help I have cured de novo, and made them ſound.</p>
                  <p>The proceſs of it is thus: drive the gluten in the binding all to one place, then launce it, where it is deepeſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, drive out its moiſture with the ſalt of red Corals (which is ſtrong enough to diſſolve that on-ſettled tartar) and then heal it with the great Opodeldoch. That tartar being out of it, then you may uſe baths, fomentations, ointments, &amp;c. elſe you cannot prevail. For if the ſlime ſtayeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, things uſed will avail nothing: and that party will be pained at the changing of the weather. I know no nearer way to cure theſe Symptomes: he that knoweth better, may bring it forth.</p>

                        <hi>Of Joint Wounds, which by ſilly Surgeons were cured to lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though not hurt to any lameneſs, how theſe muſt be remedied.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the precedent Chapter I told, that if patients be healed lame with ſtitching and Cataplaſmes, ſuffocating the joint thereby, and cauſing a lameneſs: now will I tell you, how ſuch joint wounds, being cured lame, are to be brought to right again: for the ſilly Surgeon cauſing too much fleſh to grow in ſuch a Wound, cauſed the joint to be lame.</p>
                  <p>The caſe hapneth thus: if a joint be wounded, be it in the ancles, knees, hips, elbowes, ſhoulders, hands, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then commonly theſe Wounds are dreſſed as other Wounds with oyles, Plaiſters, Ointments, and vulnerarie Potions, &amp;c. and they ſuppoſe, if the Wound onely be filled up with fleſh, then all is well: and ſo they give way to the fleſh to fill up the wound, and ſo cloſe it, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that canon I quoted above, in joint Wounds not much fleſh muſt be ſuffered to grow.</p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106818:128"/>
                  <p> Hence doubtleſs lameneſs is cauſed: for if too much fleſh <note place="margin">Cauſe of lemeneſs.</note> groweth in a joint Wound, and the Wound in the outſide cloſeth, the fleſh within ſtill groweth, and ceaſeth not to grow till it have filled up all the hollowneſs of the joint, whereby the arches of the joints are ſtopped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſomuch that it is impoſſible for that party to uſe that joint, as he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, as long as that fleſh in thoſe chambers do lodge there: for as ſoon as that joint is ſtirred, then the fleſh in that joint is ſo preſt together with painfulneſs, whereby a lameneſs is cauſed: and the party can make no uſe of that joint by reaſon of the great pains, which the overmuch growth of the fleſh doth cauſe. And this commonly befals the joints in hands, by reaſon of the plurality of the bones that are there. This rude Surgeons bring to paſs, which haſten their cures away with annointing, ſalving, ſomenting, &amp;c. ordinarily men may know, that ſuch things cannot be performed in ſuch wayes, if ſo be that the fleſh ſhut up there is thus impriſoned: therefore obſerve another proceſs, <hi>Viz.</hi> In caſe a party be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſaid manner by Surgeons ſillineſs, and you intend to help that party to right, do thus: launce the healed wound with a raſor, pretty deep, provided, you hurt neither bone nor ſinew, and enlarge the wound dayly with gentle coroſives, but in the middle of the wound, even on the hollowneſs of the joint, where the party complaineth moſt, and where you think the fault is, to leave ſome fleſh, which you may ſoon diſcern, that the coroſive powder did not touch that part of fleſh when the wound is open, and the party bloweth the joint. That fleſh in the middle you muſt looſen round to the bone, lye a four doubled threed about it, draw it cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then gently pul: if it be not quite looſe, then make it looſe with a launcet, then give a ſtronger pull, and ſee you get it out: that fleſh will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>full of ravelings and ſtreaks. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon preſently put into it the brown Ointment, and ſo dreſſe the wound twice a day with the Opodeldoch, ſo long till your cure be at an end. Make uſe onely of the Plaiſter, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to uſe any greaſie things, as oyles, poulteſſes, &amp;c. in caſe you have not the brown Ointment, then you may uſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:106818:129"/>
                  <p> Many may marvail at this ſtrange proceſs, and cure: let them obſerve, that which hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> on that fleſh, which is to be pulled out, hang many ravelings and roots, are like the little roots, which are ſcattered in the joint; which in the bowing are ſtifned and made inflexible: theſe cannot be cut out, becauſe they lye hid ſtrangely in the depths and hollowneſes of the joints, theſe cannot be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out with any coroſives, they will ſooner corrode away the ſound fleſh and bones, before they could touch the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and deeply hid roots and ſtreaks: neither is there any difficulty in this way: becauſe theſe fleſh roots hold not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt, ſlide eaſily off from their places, and that very neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and purely.</p>
                  <p>I do impart unto you alſo a fundamental inſtruction of curing of joints, lamed with a blow or fall; be it on the knees, elbowes, and hands, where the joints ſtand ſtill, and are well ſet, yet the patient cannot bow nor ſtretch them; or turn them as he would: ſuch may in ſome ſort be helped, for I brought many ſuch elbowes to right: &amp; I took an eaſier way in hand, I greaſed that joint with warmed Dialthaea, and at night I laid good ſtore upon it, and dreſt the joint with bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below and above it, in the mornings I annointed it, ſtroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it gently, ſometimes I continued it a whole hour, and every day I meaſured the joint, on his body, to ſee how far he could bring it, and two daies after, I tryed further, and tyed the joint into a ſplinter, becauſe it ſhould not ſhrink and grow ſhorter, and ſo after the pulling, I proceeded. For if a joint be ſtretched ſuddainly, uſually an exiccation befals that joint; but if done gently and by degrees, then is it advantageous to the joint, if a joint be out-ſtretched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, yet it will not keep ſo, it runs backward: and if you leave off the ſplinter, then the jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> ſwelleth or dryeth up. Therefore I ſtill ſet and bowed it gently, and brought it at laſt to its due proportion; though the out-ſtretching falls not out ſo juſt, as it doth in the bowing. Wounded joints, which lame many, ſeveral wayes, are to be underſtood and taken the ſame way as the above named joints, and uſed gently in the out-ſtretching and bowing, as much as the joint
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106818:129"/> may endure, and to lenifie them with Oitnments, Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, according as occaſion will ſerve. And to illuſtrate this cure with ſome examples: I had one of <hi>Nurnberg</hi> that was cut in his hand, and was cured lame; which I cut and lanced again, pul'd on the great ſinew, and drew it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and cured him, ſo that his hand hung no more down, as it did after the firſt cure. Another receiving a wound in his knee, was cured lame: upon occaſion he ſuddainly ſtarting up to defend himſelf, he was hurt again on that knee, but was cured then without a lameneſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was cut lame at <hi>Nurnberg</hi> on his elbow, he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without a lameneſs. I alwaies obſerved, whether it was poſſible or no to heal a wounded joint, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my ſelf accordingly, and ſtill having a care to heal the thumb upward out of the hand: and hold it better to heal a finger ſtraight, than crooked; and too ſtraight is dangerous, and an upſet hand is ſooner bowed, than a hand which hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down, to be ſet upright: and a knee and elbow is ſooner bowed, than ſtretched out, to make it ſtand right, as it ſhould.</p>

                        <hi>Of Wounds ſpoyled through external accidents, as through the heat of the Sun, and the raw ayre, and are dryed up, and how theſe ought to be remedied.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HOw can a Wound be ſpoyled by outward cauſes? and in what condition ſuch wounds are, you ſhall hear: ſome parties are wounded in a place, and cannot get from that place, where they were wounded, muſt lye under the cope of heaven in the heat of the Sun, whereby all his body is ſet in a flame, and the wound alſo is made angry, is grown brown red, dryed up, and the party commonly hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great thirſt: and if ſuch a party were to continue to lye in the heat of the Sun, death would befal him; eſpecially if the wound be in the ſcull. But if ſuch a party can be brought
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106818:130"/> to a good Surgeon in any time, then ready well prepared medicines will be aiding to Nature, with Gods bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means.</p>
                  <p>Such a wounded party happily tarryeth long in the field, <note place="margin">Wounds ſoon are burnt or ſpoiled with cold.</note> is farre from home, before he can be dreſt the wind gets into the Wound, exiccateth the ſame: and if that Wound taketh cold, if in a winter ſeaſon; then that wound is ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by froſt, and many other inconveniences are incident thereunto. Touching Wounds that are exiccated, or have taken cold, of theſe I will plainly deliver my mind, and the rather, becauſe ſuch things fall out frequently: and chiefly Surgeons to an Armie in the field, have need to be ready for ſuch accidents; for here they meet with all manner of inconveniences: when parties are either skirmiſhing, then they have no long time to bethink themſelves what to do, neither is there any occaſion to adviſe with others, the parties wounded muſt lye, till the skirmiſh is over, let the Wounds be what they will. There is great diſtinction to be obſerved touching ſuch cures, and thoſe, which to ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are not ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The cures I ſhall ſpeak of here, were not found out in mine own practice, but I have ſeen and learned them of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Surgeons; which afterward I took into careful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and in my dayly practice endeavoured ſo farre, that at laſt I got to the true fundamentals of them. And that which I have learned and ſeen, and made experiments of them, I will impart it faithfully, whereby you may ſee my intentions to be ſide and reall.</p>
                  <p>Touching theſe Wounds which are ſpoyled and exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bp the Suns heat, you are to note; if the ſuns rayes ſtrike directly into the wound, or they fall onely on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and do not come near the wound, then it may fall out, that the wound is dryed out in a ſhort time, the lips of the wound grow as hard as a ſtick: in the inſide the wound groweth brown red, like half roaſted meat, yet there is ſome moiſture in it, with a little ſwelling about, beating and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very much, great head-ach is joined with it, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is ſaint by reaſon of the great heat, which poſſeſt his body.</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:106818:130"/>
                  <p> To apply pertinent remedies for ſuch Symptomes, do thus: <note place="margin">Curs for exiccated wounds.</note> ℞ of Salmiac water ℥ 1, Roſe vinegar ℥ 3, white Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ℥ ¼, hony Roſes or mel Roſatum ℥ 6. Boyle theſe like an Egyptiacum, wet linnen ravelings in it, and tye it to the Wound. If the wound be deep made by ſtabbing, then the Ointment may be conveyed into, with a ſyringe, and apply a Plaiſter to it. Then take good Roſe vinegar, in which you diſſolve a little of prepared Saltpeter, make it luke warm, dip a cloth into, apply it four double about the Wound, covering the wound every way, that vinegar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown cold, warm it once more, and apply it again. Beware you uſe no greaſie things, of oyles ponlteſſes, &amp;c. becauſe ſuch wounds receive no greaſie things, for they are not onely not good, but hurtful. Moiſt ointments of a wateriſh nature, without greaſineſs, allay heats, and are ſharpiſh: to eat away the heat, the skin, panicle, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to open the obſtructions of the wound, that they may the better admit of healing, ſuch things you are to uſe here, if ſo be you intend to do the party good: ſuch wounds muſt not be ſtitched by no means: for theſe wounds that are thus exiccated by the Suns heat, admit of no healing, unleſs they have thruſt forth that, which the Suns heat hath ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Outward means thus applyed will not do it alone, inward <note place="margin">Internal medicines.</note> medicines muſt be uſed alſo. For a Wound ſpoiled in this manner, doubtleſs the whole body ſuffereth alſo, eſpecially when other Symptomes are coincident, as a Wound ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Feaver, an Inflamation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place phlebotomize the party on the oppoſite ſide to the Wound: The beſt way for head wounds, is to open a vein under the tongue, if the patient be able to endure it: for thereby the heat in the head will be much allayed.</p>
                  <p>When phlebotomie is uſed in this caſe, then be provided with a Vulnerarie potion, which muſt be made thus: ℞ Stellaria or Wound hearb, Biſtorta, Pyrola, white Roſes, <note place="margin">Vulnerar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> potion.</note> or Roſe water, ana ℥ 1, boile all theſe in a quart of water for an hour or two in a cloſed kan: being boiled, ſtrain
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106818:131"/> it, diſſolve in it of prepared Saltpeter ℥ 1, put to it of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſed Oculi cancrorum <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1; of theſe let the patient drink four times a day ℥ 1 ſs. This drink will come to the Wound and will expell the heat not onely out of the Wound, but out of the whole body, and will quench the patties extream thirſt.</p>
                  <p>The patient muſt be kept in a cool temper, and eat of meats which are of eaſie digeſtion; let him not be oppreſt with thirſt, which would be hurtful unto him. His drink <note place="margin">Dyet.</note> muſt be made of Barly water, of Plantain roots, and of winter Cherries: he muſt uſe alſo conſerves of Violets, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. Go on with this proceſs, ſo long till the Wound ſeparateth from that which is ſpoiled: then you may uſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, as they are proper for wounds, and proceed with the reſt, as you heard above of other wounds.</p>
                  <p>One thing more is neceſſary, if ſo be that the patient is able to endure, that he be put into a ſweat; be it with Treacle, Metridate, &amp;c. For ſuch wounds muſt be dealt <note place="margin">Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> withal, as if there had been any poyſon therein. If the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can endure ſweating, his condition will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Wound diſeaſes, or the Wound gall, (which by ſome are judged to be a kind of the plague) the patients condition is the worſe, if theſe are at hand: if the patient cannot endure to ſweat, then is he in a worſe condition, and is in great danger. Further Symptomes he is not able to undergoe, and therefore I leave to ſpeak of any more.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things you heare do befall wounds, exiccated by the Suns heat, the like befals other wounds by the Ayre and Wind, whereby they are exiccated alſo, inſomuch that they are left bloudleſs.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion and condition whereof may be learned of the patient; <hi>Viz.</hi> how long it is ſince the vvind and the air <note place="margin">Signs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccated wounds.</note> got into the Wound: if not, then the follovving ſignes muſt be regarded: the vvound is dry and doth not bleed, unleſs being toucht, it vveepeth a little, the skin of it being ſhrunk, and its lips turned: if an anger is in it, then it gapeth vvide, and that is accompanied vvith ſmarting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106818:131"/> pains: it gapeth ſometimes ſo wide, as if it were ready to ſplit in two.</p>
                  <p>If in ſuch a Wound the great muſcle of an utter joint be hurt, and a ſinew cut in tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and the joint alſo be much hurt or the ſcull of the head is cut, then the condition of the wound is the worſe, becauſe many ſimptoms are like to meet, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Wound Inflamation, on which the Cold fire atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. the Wound diſeaſe, and Wound feavers, Gout, and Cramp, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The cure of ſuch a Wound is this: <hi>Viz.</hi> ℞ well ſcummed Honey ℥ 4, Aeris viridis ℥ ſs, Vinegar ℥ 3, raw liquor of <note place="margin">Ointment for exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wounds</note> Vitriol ℥ ¼, mingle theſe, boil it like an unguentum Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum, to a ſpiſſitude: ſpread it on a long fine linnen, thruſt it down to the bottom of the Wound (provided it be not a head Wound for that muſt not be dealt ſo withal) the one end of that linnen muſt hang out of the Wound, for the eaſier puling of it out, when occaſion ſerveth. The wound muſt be filled up with that ointment, then a ſtiptick plaiſter to be applyed upon.</p>
                  <p>Then take of the oyl of white Turpentine, or ſpirit of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, one part, of diſtilled oil of Bayes one part, and of gum Amoniack one part, mingle theſe, annoint the wound about, it will penetrate, and warm the ſinews. Then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a defenſive plaiſter, and ſo proceed in that cure: uſe no greaſie ointments or poulteſſes: Keep the patient warm, dreſſe him twice or thrice a day, and phlebotomize him, if his ſtrength will allow it.</p>
                  <p>The next day I uſully minſtred to the patient this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drink; ℞ Radic, Turmentil, and Angelic, purely bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">Potion.</note>

                  <p>Endeavour to perſwade the patient unto ſweating, which if you proceed in, the patient will be ſoon the better; and <note place="margin">Sweating.</note> in the time of ſweating if he be very dry, then let him drink of boiled Barly water, let him not be oppreſt with thirſt,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106818:132"/> as I told you above alſo: it is indiſcreetly done to ſuffer ſuch patients to be thirſty overmuch, becauſe great inconvenience is cauſed thereby: it would do well, if after ſuch ſweating, the party might be phlebotomiſed: but Surgeons muſt be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated herein, as they ſee occaſion: if the party by reaſon of his faintneſs is not able to endure ſweating, then preſs him not thereto, and proceed with the reſt in that cure.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſaid things being done, then look to the wound, whether the part ſpoiled in it, inclineth to ſeparate: which is known thus: when the wound is wateriſh and mingled with ſome matter, the which hapneth not within thirty or forty hours: if that ſign be at hand, then ceaſe to uſe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the above named ointment, and take good wound oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put that into the wound, and apply an Opodeldoch or ſtiptick Plaiſter upon, &amp; make uſe alſo of a defenſive Plaiſter. In caſe you dare not truſt to all theſe, then let him ſweat twice more, for more ſecurity ſake, and proceed in the reſt as you heard above. The Cramp is uſually joined hereunto; what you are to do in that caſe, you ſhal find in its due place.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſpeak of abuſes committed in theſe, whereby patients are bereaved of their joints, and ſometimes of their lives alſo.</p>
                  <p>This abuſe is partly committed, by ſtitching, which is ſtark nought to be uſed here: becauſe that fleſh in the wound, exiccated and ſpoiled by air or cold, the ſame aſſimilateth no more, but is to ſeparate off; and how can it well ſeparate, if pull'd together with ſtitching: beſides theſe ſtitches will not tarry, but tear out, becauſe the lips of the wound are turn'd outward; and in caſe ſuch a wound ſhould be thus ſtitched, the cold fire would ſoon get into the ſtitch.</p>
                  <p>Some Surgeons committed great faults herein, cauſing great hurts to the parties. <hi>Viz.</hi> Aſſoon as ſuch a party fals into their hands, then they preſently uſe their Wound oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Balſam to the Wound, which is improper hereto: becauſe ſuch Wounds admit of no healing, unleſs the ſpoiled fleſh be ſeparated and be out of the Wound: which exicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cooled fleſh comes not out of the vvound of its ovvn accord, but muſt be aided. Therefore ſharp ointments are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106818:132"/> to be put into ſuch Wounds, vvhich ceaſe on the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fleſh, and eat it off, and thereby to prevent that the ſound fleſh and veins be not infected.</p>
                  <p>Which cannot be done, if onely wound Oiles and Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be uſed, becauſe theſe cannot rectifie that corrupted and ſpoyled fleſh, but rather make it worſe: which to prove, I could quote many exam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es, upon good reaſons; whereby illeterate men of an ordinary capacity may be perſwaded unto. And if it ſhould happen that a party was cured by ſuch oiles, and ointment, ſurely a great many to that one have miſcarryed.</p>
                  <p>I have known ſuch Surgeons, which replyed, that ſuch Wounds had not their due excretions, onely watered a little; yet they went on in their ſalving, annointing, to the utter ruine of their patients: though that the patient felt that the pains of the utter parts of the joints encreaſed more and more, inclining to an Impoſthume by reaſon of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al beating and pulling: heowever they continued in their courſe, obſtinately, ſuppoſing their way to be the beſt.

                  <p>To make it more plain: if a ſinew or muſcle be wounded, then uſually they begin to weep, and yeild a moiſture, which moiſture, as you heard above, never comes to any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the skin being cloſed on that part, and that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath no iſſue, it filleth up that place in a ſhort time, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that place is enforced to an up-ſwelling. The ſinews ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fellow feeling herein, may ſoon be ſet on a heat, which in time turning to a ſharp humor, may make the thing worſe. For the joint water or radical humor running from the ſinews, joining with a ſharp humor, how ſoon may that humor inflame and corrode the ſinews and veins, and may eaſily be ſuffocated, if no vent made for it.</p>
                  <p>Though this hapneth alſo to other places, as you heard, yet uſually it befals hands, and feet betwixt the toes and ancles, becauſe there is a meeting of many ſmall bones, veins and ſinews, and little fleſh joined to them: and in ſuch places ſuch wounds may the ſooner be inflicted. And becauſe no congealed blood, nor ſpots appear there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſilly Surgeons ſuppoſe the place to be in the leſſe peril, and all is well to their ſeeming: and ignorantly they let it run on ſo long, till all be paſt help.</p>
                  <p>If any ſuch party comes to your hand, being hurted by a blow, fling, fall, on his hand, foot, knee, elbow, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few daies it begun to raiſe, ſwelleth, its pains encreaſeth more and more, yet no ſign appearing of congealed blood, or other fracture, nor any ſinews or veins ſeems to be hurt, then is it a ſure ſign, that the Synonia or moiſture from the ſinews doth ſeparate, and beginneth to be in a furie.</p>

In this caſe above the ſwelling there muſt be made another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and mix the brown Ointment with the Balſam of ſweet Arſenick, make tents of it, as you heard above about the brown Ointment: thruſt theſe tents into the uppermoſt hole, once a day, then the anger of it will be allayed, and the dying of the ſinews ſhall creep no further: then other convenient means may be uſed, of good wound Ointments, &amp;c. and ſo go on with the cure ſo long till the ill be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

And that joint alſo being bereaved of its food, it had from the ſinews, then the cold fire will get into, which bringeth death upon the party.

                  <p>In the firſt place it is to be noted, that all kind of ſwellings
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106818:134"/> do not come into the number of dangerous Symptomes: thoſe are of the dangerous ones, when ſinews, bones, joints, &amp;c. are grievouſly wounded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>welled: of that ſort having a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of its ſwellings; I intend not to ſpeak of: becauſe if the wound doth frame well to healing, the reſt in time will paſs away.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort of ſwelling, coming after healing, I intend to give a hint of, <hi>Viz.</hi> An utter joints muſcle, being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and well healed, was by the Surgeon kept too hot, and with Cataplaſmes ſuffocated: after which ſuch a wound begins to ſwell, at the beginning being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pains, when toucht, nor altering the colour. Such a ſwelling paſſeth away in tow or three weeks time, but leaveth behind a pain, which continueth with an increaſe: and the ſwelling being quite gone, it is found, that on that joint a great deal is tender, and that hapneth as it were in a ſleep, not payning the party.</p>
                  <p>For to prevent this ſwelling, and to hinder that conſuming <note place="margin">A plaiſter to prenent the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drying.</note> and updrying of the joint, much ſalving, dawbing, annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. they have uſed; but I never ſaw any, which hath done more good, then the enſuing Receipt, ℞ meal of Fig beanes ℥ 1, meal of common Beans ℥ 3, well beaten Orras ℥ 1, pulveriſed Marigold flowers ℥ ¼, gum Amoniack ℥ ¼, boil theſe to a ſpiſſitude with vinegar, ad to it of diſtilled Anniſe ſeed oyle ℥ 3, of emplaſtrum Diaguilon ℥ 5, the emplaſtrum muſt firſt be melted, and then with the ſaid oyle be mingled and ſtirred with the Cataplaſme: ſpread a cloth with it anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to the bigneſs of the ſwelling, apply it warm, in few dayes the ſvvelling will be aſſvvaged, and no exiccation vvill enſue. Becauſe the vertue of the Plaiſter expels and outdravveth all humors, before they ſhall come to any ſettlement in ſuch places. There are other means expelling vvinds and humors: <hi>viz.</hi> Anniſe, Fennel, Carravvay ſeeds, &amp;c. as alſo Diura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick means may de uſed.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT old formerly, that Surgeons muſt obſerve what diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their patients are ſubject unto, or troubled withal, that their medicines might be applyed adcordingly: for theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors coincident to the wound, require anſwerable cures: I intend not to ſpeak of all ſuch Symptomes, but will give
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106818:135"/> onely a hint of one or other, whereby the reſt may be judged, how they ought to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Some pocky people happily are wounded: theſe do not love te hear much of that infirmity, however they cannot <note place="margin">Wounds of pocky folks.</note> be cured in their wounds, as thoſe which were not defiled with them: for ſuch pocky humors will take their courſe to wounds, ſettle there, and are uſually obſtructive to heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Surgeons have reaſon here to look to themſelves, how to cure ſuch: they may know there by the matter, and the perſons they have in hand.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all to cure ſuch wounds, things above ſaid muſt be known, and in caſe theſe will not be cured by ordinary dreſſings, then other means muſt be taken in hand.</p>
                  <p>Note; no Mercury is to be uſed to the ſymtomes of ſuch wounds, be it prepared for fixation or otherwiſe; becauſe Mercuries quality is to take away all impurities: and if Mercury ſhould be uſed to a wound of a pockyfied party, that morbus would be rowzed, and the party would be brought to deaths door.</p>
                  <p>The cure of ſuch wounds is thus: ℞ Flos aeris <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1, cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis ℥ ¼, Aloes Hepatick ℥ ſs, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, <hi>ana</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs, Sallat oyle ℥ 4, Wax, Terpentine <hi>ana</hi> ℥ ¼, melt the Wax, Turpentine, and Oyl with Vernice ℥ ½, then put the reſt to it, ſtir it well, ſo long, till it be cold. Uſe this Ointment to the wounds, apply a ſtiptick Plaiſter upon it, it will heal the wound.</p>
                  <p>In caſe this ſaid ointment ſhould not prevail, then uſe the red liquor of Vitriol to it, which will inforce the wound unto healing: and make it thus: ℞ of Vitriol lb 2 purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with freſh rain water, let it dry, then calcine it to a yellowiſh colour, then pour on it again freſh water lb 8, exiccate it again, then ſet it into a Reverberatory, to bring it to ſome rubification, then put it in a glaſs, pour on it rectified Aquavitae, that it ſtand two fingers breadth over it, which will tinge the Aquavitae to a redneſs: Cant off this Aquavitae, and pour other on it to be ting'd, which put to the firſt. This ting'd Aquavitae is to be extracted per Balneum, a ſpiſſitude of honey remaining on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106818:136"/> on this muſt be poured freſh Alcool vinj, to take out the tincture. Cant of that purely, and abſtract the Alcool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Balneo to a liquid form, then is it prepared.</p>
                  <p>This liquor is of an attractive or to get her drawing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is not corroſive, and is a principal ſoveraign thing for ſpoiled wounds, where bodily humors are like to be incident: this may be ſafely uſed for ſpraines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wounds received in warlick ſervices.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman not long agoe received a wound in his face, who was pockified, but would not hear of it; the pocky humor faling into the wound, did burn much, and eat into: ſome Surgeons being ſent for, they went about to uſe precipitated Mercury, thereby to cleanſe and keep the wound clean; But what happened? Morbus Gallicus was thereby rowzed, and that humor was forced to come abundantly to the wound, and the mouth was full of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. I being called thereunto, ſoon found what was done, and the patient was fain to yield to a pocky cure.</p>
                  <p>This example I quote to that end, becauſe ſome Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Mercury not uſeful in many things.</note> ſuppoſe they can prepare Mercury ſo, that he can be fitted like a Saddle for any horſe, little conſidering, that Mercury is naught for freſh wounds, be it as artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared, as ever it may: becauſe he is too ſearching, which is not alwaies good in theſe waies.</p>
                  <p>Many other Symptomes do concur in patients: one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample I will quote, which is very remarkable, whereby <note place="margin">A notable example of a woman.</note> others may be judged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. not farre from <hi>Baſell,</hi> an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, (which ſhall go nameleſs) was cutting a ſtick one time with a ſharp knife, but the ſtick breaking at her hard laying on, ſhe cut her hand, near the joint, fleſh, skin, ſinews, veins, all in pieces. A Barbar Surgeon being ſent for, dreſt her, and that cure went on well unto healing for twenty daies together, as both the Surgeon and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman affirmed it: now which of theſe two was faulty, I cannot tell: one night a humor fell into that wound run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the wound like wateriſh bloud, cauſing ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paines. The Barbar holding it to be the joint water,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106818:136"/> uſed all the means he ſuppoſed to be good againſt it, but did no good. A Phyſitian and two other Surgeons were called, theſe alſo counted it a joint water, adviſing their remedies to be uſed to oppoſe it. Here was affliction upon affliction, and no eaſe or help: the Gentlewoman had no reſt neither by day nor by night, and that continued for a whole week, then the humor ſtayd, and the party had ſome eaſe. But that humor had corroded all that which was healed theſe twenty dayes, her whole arm was much ſwelled and inflamed, and with much adoe that wound was hardly brought to that ſtate it was in, in fourteen dayes, ſo much was it come out of order. They ſuppoſing now, that all things were brought again into a good poſture, and that all dangers were paſt. Behold four weeks after the ſaid humor fell again into that wound, cauſing as much pains as ever it did before; Phyſitians were much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, not knowing what to do. At that time it fell out, that I went to dreſſe a Gentlemans child, which had a hurt on the ancle, wherein a callus was grown, being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Surgeons. The other party hearing of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, ſent for me; I beheld and viewed the wound, and found that that humor was no joint water: I preſently ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gentlewoman about her monethly courſes, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſhe had them not ſince ſhe was wounded: then I perceived what humor that was, for I had ſeveral ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes under hand, their cure I learned ſtrangely.</p>
                  <p>I proceeded thus: firſt of all I opened on her foot the Saphena, then I made a peſſary of Hellebore niger, to be put into the matrix: thereby the humor was brought to its natural channel, ſhe found eaſe inſtantly, all pains were gone, and was cured, which the party thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Others marvailed at the cure, ſome whereof held it impoſſible, that according to my direction ſuch a cure ſhould be performed: but they could ſay nothing againſt the thing being as clear as the Sun. The like muſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Cancer on Womens breaſts, bellies, or privy places, which ſores or ulcers are mortal, if their courſes be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: all your medicines will not prevail, unleſs their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

                  <p>One thing more I muſt tell: if you have ſuch a Woman <note place="margin">No inward medicins to be uſed.</note> in hand, to cure her of a wound, then beware you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her not with any internal medicaments; for ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are not ſo ſoon ſtayed: and though you ſuppoſe to reduce ſuch humors by inward medicaments, it will availe nothing: for in that caſe that humor will not keep its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe, but comes forth at the wound, and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that inward medicine is, the more it will ſpoile the wound. Therefore make uſe onely of the above named Peſſarie, or other fomentations, perfumes, bathings, &amp;c. according as experience ſhall miniſter occaſion.</p>

                  <p>HItherto I have made mention often, about the Wound-diſeaſe, and Wound-feaver or Ague: my intention here is, to ſpeak more largely of it, the rather, becauſe there is not a worſe Symptome; and theſe are not alone by themſelves, when they come: but Apoplexie, Palſie, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, &amp;c. do accompany them: of theſe I ſhall ſpeak no more, then my practick hath revealed unto me. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe here but muſt ſpeak of a miſtake about the wound diſeaſe, becauſe they talk of it, as if there were no more but one ſort of Wound diſeaſe, and make no diſtinction herein: and becauſe that diſtinction is not obſerved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending it all under one cure, is the cauſe why ſo many patients are neglected.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:106818:137"/>
                  <p> There are three ſorts of diſeaſes, which befall Wounds: <note place="margin">A threefold wound diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</note> the one is not cured like the other; and what is good for the one, is naught for the other: and the one diſeaſe is more dangerous than the other. Therefore it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and foul abuſe, when ſome pretend ſaying, if one is underſtood and cured, the reſt alſo may be cured in the ſame manner. The firſt ſort is called a Wound Ague, or Feaver, or the Wounds fire: becauſe at its firſt coming it <note place="margin">Wound A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</note> is exceeding cold, ſhaking the whole body like a ſtrong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, then a ſtrong heat followeth upon, and a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the whole body enſueth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort is called the Shaking, or the Wound-gall, <note place="margin">Wound gall.</note> it comes with a ſhivering cold, no heat followeth, but a great pain in the Wound: commonly there is ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wound a little clear bliſter, or in the outſide there is a brown one, which is full of bloud.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort of the Wound diſeaſe, is called the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or unquietneſs within, which is onely within, without <note place="margin">Beating in the wound.</note> any ſhaking Ague, when it comes, but it comes with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſmarting pains, with heat and cold joined: the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hath no reſt neither by day nor by night, continually turning and winding this or that way.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the three diſtinct and ſeveral ſorts of Wound-ſimptomes, of theſe I intend to write, yea rather becauſe I nere ſaw any thing written of it fundamentally. It is ſtrange that ſo little is exſtant in writing of the ſigns hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mentioned, about the Wound diſeaſes, being a thing of ſuch high concernment, and ought to be timely prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Surgeons regard them not, watching onely for their end, yet know not what to do, or how to handle theſe things. When ſuch a Symptom is come to the wound, and the patient in great anguiſh, and the thing is come to extreamity, then they conceive of a ſimptom in the wound, but know not what it is. But experience ſheweth, what the event is of ſuch ſimptoms. Theſe men not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſorts of theſe ſimptoms in the wound, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great heat about the patient, yet cannot diſcern that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106818:138"/> it is a Wound diſeaſe; then they are buſie to cure that Wound diſeaſe as an ordinary Ague, hoping with their coolers to expell that heat, uſing Nenupharine, Poppy ſeeds, Solatrum, &amp;c. and thereby they uſe things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto it. But doth not experience tell, that ſuch Parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſmes cannot be allayed and kept off by their coolers? true the great dryneſs and thirſt they quench, but it was not ſeen that they ever cured the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Though ſuch a patient be plebotomiſed, yet is the diſeaſe not expelled thereby, as every one may judge; though plebotomie is of good uſe in ſuch caſes, and that is the reaſon, why ſo many dye of it; becauſe ſuch diſeaſes are not rightly oppoſed: and if any recovereth of it, they have the more cauſe to be thankful unto God, that granted them ſo much ſtrength, when neither plebotomy, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would help them.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of the firſt ſort of the Wound diſeaſe, Note, that <note place="margin">Cold. Of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the wound.</note> that is commonly the moſt dangerous wound: if that ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom befalls the wound, eſpecially a head wound, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it bringeth death: and many patients looſe their lives in that kind. This ſimptom is the worſt among the reſt, and its effect is as bad as the plague it ſelf. It comes firſt with a chillineſs, whereupon there followeth a mighty cold, and then ſmarting pains in the head: if that wound be in a place, where there is a concurrence of great muſcles, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, white veins, then the patient groweth ſomewhat out of his wit, and talketh idely: and if he recovereth not his right ſenſes in tow or three daies, then is it a ſign of death: if that paroxiſme comes above three times, then is the ſign of death the ſurer.</p>
                  <p>This is that ſimptom, whereof ſo many dye. For it is an uſual ſaying, if the patient outliveth five, ſeven, or nine dayes, then he eſcapeth with his life. Some ſet that time further off, to the thirtieth or thirty fifth day, which is not very uncertain neither. For if a ſimptom cometh not into the wound within twelve or fifteen daies, then it will not come at all or very ſeldom; unleſs the Surgeon or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient haſten it on. But if the wound be not ſo dangerous,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106818:138"/> then no great carefulneſs is need; unleſs the Pia Mater un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the skull be wounded, for then ſtrange ſimptoms muſt be expected, which happen when they dream leaſt of it, as you heard above about Head wounds.</p>
                  <p>Touching this cold or ague in the wound, Note; how it may be diſcerned before its coming. For my meaning is not, that Surgeons ſhould ſtay for the ſeventh or ninth day, when its full fore is come already into it. Experience teacheth, that an enemy is with leſs oppoſition kept off from invaſion, than beaten out, when invaded already.</p>
                  <p>The original of this Wound Ague, which cauſeth great miſchief, is variouſly diſcourſed of; even among thoſe, which do not underſtand it. My intent is not to be large in the writing of it, only for Novices ſake in Surgery, and the good of patients, I will ſhew, how this ſimptom is known, and how it is to be healed.</p>
                  <p>If you deſire to know exactly, from whence a Wound <note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the wound diſ-</note> diſeaſe hath its original, let them take notice of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things: Its commonly cauſed by anger, frights &amp; fears, great pains, and diſorderly life in eating &amp; drinking unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I forbear to ſpeak here of bad medicines: in a word; according as the wound is in a dangerous place, and in a dangerous joint or member: (the one being nobler than the other) eſpecially the Head is the nobleſt, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the blow, cut, ſtab, is made, and in what years ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo ſimptomes will be accordingly. Nothing bringeth ſo ſoon on ſuch ſimptomes, than when a party is wounded in a dangerous place, and the wound bleedeth vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and other Nations obſerve this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that if a patient hath bled nere ſo much, they will plebotomize him further, which is an ill and refuſable way. For a patient, which looſeth too much bloud, looſeth alſo much of his natural colour, whereby he groweth cold and faint. And if the wound be on a dangerous place, then pains are cauſed; theſe pains cauſe anger, anger cauſeth heat, upon which the foreſaid paroxiſme followeth infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly: heat and cold ſtriving and fighting one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106818:139"/> at laſt the cold being conquered, heat got the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy, whereby all is ſet on a flame. This heat and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom lyeth in man like a ſmoak or fume, and muſt by force be expelled; becauſe otherwiſe it cannot be extinguiſhed: and coolers can do little in this particular. Syrups, Juleps, Conſerves of Bugloſſe and Borrage will avail here nothing: and with theſe Surgeons commit groſſe errours. I have been preſent ſometimes, when the Phyſitian felt the patients pulſe, which is not ſo improper neither, then viewed or caſt his water, finding him to be in a ſtrong feaver, and it was ſo. Then preſently ſome Syrups muſt be mixed, and with Cordials the patient muſt be upheld, with Goat milk, Syrup, Conſerves, &amp;c. but none of theſe men knew, where that Ague did lye, nor where the fault was: the one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be a continual Ague, the other judged it to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe: every one had his own judgement of it, the one contradicting the other. But what was the patient the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for their jarring? I never ſaw any patient cured with diſputing: my ſelf differed ſometimes in my judgement concerning ſuch ſimptoms, but Experience ſhewed me the better way.</p>
                  <p>This Wound Ague, (to come to the point, according <note place="margin">To diſcern the wound ague.</note> to my promiſe made afore) to diſcern well before its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are to note; that when that Wound ſimptom is coming, the patient is unquiet, ſtares up and down, loſt his ſleep, and if he ſlumbereth, be ſtarteth, awakneth, and is unquiet. If the Wound be on a joint, then he doth not hold ſtill, ſtriveth continually to ſhift this or that way, and then it is commonly angered. But the patient muſt firſt be well obſerved, whether he ſweateth in his ſleep, (as you heard above alſo) they do not uſually ſweat, though they are hot enough, and are much gready for drink.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this alſo ought to be noted, if a wounded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath a deep red color in his face, more than, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly before he was wounded; or he looketh paler, yet is hot in his body, which he was not ſo before he was wounded, then is it a ſure ſign of this ſimptoms coming; which we ſpeak of now. Theſe and ſuch like ſigns are to be obſerved in the outſide of the patient.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:106818:139"/>
                  <p> But the knowledge of the wound is of chiefeſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: if the wound be in ſuch a condition, as I ſhall ſpeak of the like about the Prunella or Inflamation; (thither I commit the Reader) then is it a ſign of the coming of the Wound ſimptome. For if Nature be ſo ſtrong, as to keep the Prunella in the ſaid joint, and not to let it run into the body, then the cold fire comes into, and nothing elſe; but if that heat in that joint preſſeth backward into the body, then it cauſeth a Wound ſimptom. Theſe two ſimptoms meeting, are a ſure meſſenger of death.</p>
                  <p>Theſe following ſigns, which concern not the Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prunella, are to be obſerved alſo. If a Wound be freſh and new, not much touchy, ſo that the patient may ſuffer to be toucht well, and being toucht hard, he feeleth it ſmart; this is the firſt ſign of all: eſpecially if the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpeaketh quick, and looketh agazed: it is a ſign, that ſuch a party is mightily infected, and is to look for that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſme, accompanied with perril of death.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo theſe ſigns, which the coming of the wound diſeaſe giveth you to underſtand. If a Wound look pale and a dead colour about the corners and lips, but the wound within looks brown red; and the patient is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run in his body with a ſtrong continued heat, and keepeth in that ſtrong heat, groweth not cold or clammy, (as it uſually hapneth in other ſorts of wound diſeaſes, which muſt be obſerved for diſtinction ſake) and that ſtrong heat and feaver goeth on, to the coming of a paroxiſme, after which there followeth yet a ſtrong heat and inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may ſoon make an end of the patient.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I muſt relate, touching the increaſe or <note place="margin">Signes from the Moon.</note> decreaſe of the Moon, according to which commonly wounds are affected. When a patient groweth ſtill weaker at the decreaſe of the Moon, then you may expect at the new Moon a heavy and dangerous paroxiſme: if the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent continueth in a ſtrong heat at the increaſe of the Moon, it ſignifieth that a wound ſimptom is come, or any other bad accident, which is ſo, if the aforeſaid ſigns appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; elſe it hath another meaning, however it ſignifieth but
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106818:140"/> little good. Theſe ſigns ſpoken of, Surgeons ought to obſerve diligently, and learn thereby to diſcern a coming wound ſimptom, that they may oppugne and repell, or keep them off, (before they be quite come) the preventing of them is eaſier then their expelling after they are come.</p>
                  <p>It is time now to tell, how this ſimptom is to be oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: <note place="margin">Cure of wound ſimptom.</note> I will ſpeak of it as I found it experimentally. I do not hold my proceſs forth in that manner, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parraleled; only this I ſay; I found it to be the ſafeſt and beſt. Note, I comprehend all into one cure, whether a ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom be coming, or be come already. You muſt conſider, that if a wound diſeaſe be diſcerned in its ſigns, before its coming, then is it needleſs that ſtrong medicines be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as when a paroxiſme had been over. For this cure I applied not when an inflamation was already in the wound diſeaſe, for then it muſt be ordered otherwiſe, as you ſhall here in its due place.</p>
                  <p>The foreſaid ſigns of the wound diſeaſe having appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then have a care to remove pictures out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where the patient lyeth; for patients being very weak, and beholding ſuch pictures, cauſeth in their fancies ſtrange imaginations, whereby they are frightned and amazed, which maketh ſimptoms to be cured with more difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cure it ſelf, as I have learned in my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, I ordered for the wound diſeaſe, where the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme was gone, which being done, then miniſter unto the patient of this following Aquavitae, from one to two and a half ounce, according to the condition of the patient; and let him ſweat upon them very well.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the party cannot ſweat (which uſually hapneth) then heat Tiles, or Brick ſtones, moiſten them with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, <note place="margin">To cauſe ſweat.</note> wrap them into a cloth, and apply them to his feet in the bed; or to any other place, where you think it fit, and ſo let him ſweat, as much as he is able to endure.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the party is to ſweat thus, notwithſtanding he is hot already; then take of Goats milk lb 1, of diſtilled <note place="margin">To expel heat, cauſed by ſweating.</note> water of Nightſhade ℥ 1, dryed or freſh Alkekengj ℥ ſs, pulveriſed Fenegreek ℥ 3, of Roſe water ℥ 1 ſs; boil theſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106818:140"/> to a ſpiſſe Cataplaſme; ſpread it on a cloth, apply it warm to the right ſide to the region of the liver, then that heat, cauſed by ſweating will not prejudice him.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be applied to the right ſide where the liver ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it be not too much inflamed, that muſt lye there, whileſt he is ſweating. To the pulſes both on hands and feet muſt be applied a four doubled cloth, dipped in Roſe water, where Saltpeter was diſſolved in: doubtleſs the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will find himſelf well after his ſweating.</p>
                  <p>His dyet muſt be of eaſie digeſting meat, it would not be amiſſe to put among his meat ſome ſirup of Nenupha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: after the ſweat other medicaments may operate; which ought to be noted. If the party be coſtive, then make a gliſter of fleſh broth, prepared of Mallowes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momils, Roſe oyl, you may if you pleaſe, or you ſee it fitting, mingle with it, two three or five drams of Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arium de ſucco Roſarum, which will cool the body within gently, and do more good than other purges, this may be iterated, if need be, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This cure is ordered for a wound diſeaſe, when it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come: But when it is but coming, and you intend to prevent its coming, which will be the beſt way, then the medicaments ought not to be ſo ſtrong; therefore a doſe of the foreſaid Aquavitae, will be enough of ℥ 1 ſs: in the reſt you proceed as you were told.</p>
                  <p>Touching the wounds, it is the ſafeſt way to uſe to it the brown ointment, and apply on it a ſtiptick Plaiſter. If <note place="margin">Cure of the wounds.</note> there be any heat in it, then uſe round about the wound unguentum dialthaeae, or oleum Roſatum: I love not to have the wounds too cool, becauſe coolers are not very good in theſe wayes. At laſt apply to it a good defenſive Plaiſter, and look to the healing, which doubtleſs will ſoon appear, aſſoon as ſweating is over.</p>
                  <p>All theſe being done, the patient and the wound being in a better condition, then go on with that cure, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Artem, till to the end of it.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the patient is not yet ſettled for to have his ſleep quietly, then uſe that precious Pill Anodynum.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:106818:141"/>
                  <p> The Aquavitae which I made mention of in this Chapter, is prepated thus.</p>
                  <p>Take the beſt Aquavitae, without any phlegme in it, called <note place="margin">Aquavitae for wound froſt or ague.</note> Alcool, lb 1, put it in a glaſs body, put to it of raſp'd Harts horn ℥ 6, mingle with it pulveriſed Myrrh ℥ 2, lute the glaſs carefully that nothing vapour away, let it ſtand thus infuſed for eight dayes; then diſtil gently off the Aquavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae in Balneo, ſo that the feces may ſtay dry behind: this abſtracted Aquavitae pour on the feces again, diſtill again very gently, iterate it a third time: put this Aquavitae in a wide glaſſe of a narrow mouth, then put into it well pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſed Myrrh ℥ 1, filed Harts horn ℥ 2. Mithridate ℥ ſs, Camphor <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 2, cloſe the glaſs exactly; ſerva ad uſum. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtood a moneth and none of it uſed, then cant it off, put away the feces, and put freſh materials formerly named into it, let it ſtand well cloſed; it is precious, hath great vertues, to purifie the blood, and to expell all venome. Camphor by reaſon of its penetrative ſpirit and harmleſs hot quality, is one of the chiefeſt things in it.</p>
                  <p>In caſe ſuch Aquavitae cannot be had, then you may uſe Treacle, or Mithridate, &amp;c. but that will not do ſo well, as the ſaid Aquavitae, for reaſons known, needleſs to be related here. And thus much of the firſt Wound diſeaſe.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis alſo is one of the worſt ſimptoms, which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal <note place="margin">A wound gall is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> a wound, whereof many dyed, and are like to dye hereafter; becauſe it is hardly well known, and its cure neither known nor uſed. All which is occaſioned, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the foreſaid diſtinction, which ought to have been obſerved about the Wound diſeaſe; but they comprehend all under one cure, which ſhould not be, as you may judge by that which enſueth. As dangerous this ſimptom is, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106818:141"/> as ſuddenly it may be a danger of death to the patient; ſo eaſie and ſuddenly is it cured alſo, provided, the thing be well underſtood, not elſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſimptom I heard it called the Wound gall, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Why called a wound gall: why a ſhaking.</note> of its form: ſome call it the ſhaking or quaking, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs becauſe it ſeizeth on the patient with a quaking, as if it were an ague. For my part I know not what other name to give it, nor why I ſhould hold it for any other: ſhould I call it an Anthrax or no? it may aſſoon and as eaſie be <note place="margin">Anthrax.</note> cured as an Anthrax: a futher diſcourſe of it I commit to the learned, let them diſpute of it ſo long, till they find a true and proper name for it: if my opinion herein ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, I ſhould ſay that it is a ſpecial ſort of Wound diſeaſe, becauſe its cure is almoſt like the great Wound diſeaſe; only it requireth no ſuch great toyling.</p>
                  <p>To know and to diſcern this ſimptom, note; I know as yet not any fundamental or reall ſign of it, whereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <note place="margin">Signes.</note> its coming, not unleſs it be come. For that reaſon I will not ſpeak here, what others do think of; doubtleſs it hath its ſignes, whereby it may be diſcerned: every one is to have his own obſervations about it, if I meet with any I ſhall be ready to let the Reader know it.</p>
                  <p>Where ever this ſimptom is fallen in, it appeareth and is conditioned in the following manner. Firſt the patient feeleth a ſhivering, no other, as if it were an Ague. But upon this ſhaking there doth not follow neither heat nor head ach, as it is uſual in the ordinary great Wound diſeaſe (unleſs the wound be in the head) which diſtinction or difference ought to be carefully obſerved, as being of great conſequence. An extream miſery and pain befals the wound with panting and beating, making the wound extreamly out of order.</p>
                  <p>Within the wound where the greateſt pain is, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a bright bliſter, but ſomewhat darkiſh: if the wound be deep, and it being made with a thruſt, then the bliſter cannot alwaies be ſeen: therefore the judgement of it muſt be taken from the cold pain, cauſed by the chillineſs.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:106818:142"/>

                  <p> But in caſe the foreſaid bliſter be not in the wound, but without or beſide it, then is it brown, of the bigneſs of a pea, is full of blood, and feeleth hard, with a hard ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling round about the wound, having no ill colour. If theſe be let alone, then the ſaid bliſter falls again inwards, gets a hole, leaving a ſcarre after it, very white with a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh ring; preſently after there appears black ſpots, and look like the cold fire: by and by there followeth upon a great heat, and vehement head ach, then enſueth a palſie, next is death.</p>
                  <p>There is exactly to be obſerved alſo, that if a patient is <note place="margin">Note.</note> taken with a Wound gall (ſo I name it now) he hath no deſire to turn this and that way, and as they ſay to hop up and down, as thoſe do, which are troubled with the great Wound diſeaſe: but he lyeth ſtill, and ſtands out his time, not without great complaining, by reaſon of the continued increaſing pain. For if he ſtirreth then his pain increaſeth, and is forced to be quiet againſt his will.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cure of this ſimptom, it is thus: Take of the preſcribed Aquavitae ℥ 1, Oculi cancrorum <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1, which <note place="margin">Cure.</note> muſt be well grinded; mingle theſe, let the patient drink it, cover him well, cauſe him to ſweat in his bed, for this ſweat is of great concernment: if the patient be loth to ſweat, or is difficult for him to do, yet however you muſt keep him to it; for no ſooner the ſweat cometh, then he will be at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>About the wound apply the Anodyne ointment, and let ſome of it be put into it, in caſe you do not ſee the bliſter within: apply to the wound a ſtiytick plaiſter, in which muſt be no Raſom, or any ſuch thing, which is of an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive quality; for the patient would thereby be put to more ſmarting pains, which would prejudice the party.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as he hath done ſweating, then plebotomize him next to the place where he is wounded, and let the vein run reaſonable well, doubtleſs the pains in the wound will be allayed, after which you may cure the party with more facility. Let him forbear meats hot of ſpices.</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:106818:143"/>
                  <p> And becauſe the bliſter, (being broken by ſweating, and is no more mortall) maketh ſtill the wound disformed, ſo that it groweth brown and weeping, then it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that you uſe the brown ointment for one or two daies till the wound be well cleanſed, then go on with the cure according to Art.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the third ſort of Wound diſeaſe, called the pulling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs in the wound.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Symptom is known unto expert Surgeons; and it hath its name anſwerable unto its deed. I ſhould have written of it afore, before I had told of the other ſorts, and that the rather, becauſe the great wound diſeaſe, which I have deſcribed at firſt, commonly is cauſed from thence: but I purpoſely delayed it to this place, for ſome reaſons. For though the great wound diſeaſe (thus I call the firſt ſort for diſtinction ſake, and others alſo call it by that name) is cauſed ſometimes of or by this laſt ſort, (which for ſome reaſons I call the unquiet:) yet this alſo is true, that the wound diſeaſe for the moſt part cometh into the wound, whereas the unquietneſs hath not yet been felt in the wound. This unquietneſs, though it be bad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enough, yet is it no ſo perrilous as the great wound diſeaſe; therefore it requireth the leſs care than the other, in reſpect of the pains, which are not ſo grievous.</p>
                  <p>Touching other things, together with the cure: there is found alſo a great difference eaſie to be diſcerned by him, which taketh notice of.</p>
                  <p>From whence that unquietneſs cometh into the wound, <note place="margin">From whence that Unquiet in the wound.</note> is needleſs to make any further diſcourſe of it. Even the ſame cauſe, which cauſeth the great wound diſeaſe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo the unquietneſs in the wound, and that ſooner and ſuddainly: therefore the unquietneſs cometh ſooner into the wound, than the great or firſt ſort of wound diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106818:144"/> which uſually cometh then, when the patients wound beginneth wholly to come off at the end.</p>
                  <p>When that unquietneſs is coming into the wound; then <note place="margin">Signes.</note> ſhieverings and chlillineſs runneth over the patient, which are not ſo vehement with quaking as other ſorts of wound diſeaſes uſually do. This cold ſhaking runneth about a long time in the body, afterward it ſetleth to the wounded member or joint, from thence into the wound, where it cauſeth horrible pains, with heat, cold, inſomuch that the patient doth not know, what ayleth him.</p>
                  <p>The wounded member he is not able to reſt it any where, <note place="margin">Why it is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs.</note> ſtill ſhifting from place to place, hoping to find eaſe in one place or other. Therefore this wound diſeaſe is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs, becauſe the patient ſtill moveth the wounded joint, like the jack of a watch doth move.</p>
                  <p>If the wound be on the body, its not the better; becauſe the patient will ſtir himſelf to and fro, and to turn this and that ſide, whereby great inconveniency may be cauſed. If the wound be in the head, then is it very dangerous, if it <note place="margin">Very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous if a wound in the head.</note> ſhould hold him long; by reaſon of the Cramp, Palſie, &amp;c. which eaſily is incident alſo. The party cannot ſleep, though inclined to it; and if in a ſlumber, yet that pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beating rowſeth him to an amazement, pulling the wounded joint after, the which increaſeth his pain: it is a moſt pittiful thing to behold ſuch a party.</p>
                  <p>If this ſimptom be not oppoſed, then there enſueth an extraordinary heat, and one inconvenience followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, at laſt the great wound diſeaſe is incident into it; which proveth a mortal ſign: from that, I never ſaw any come off, or recover of it, though all means are uſed. For theſe two ſimptoms meeting are deadly enemies one to another, make a quick dipatch of the patient, not ſtaying for any medicament.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this unquietneſs muſt be oppoſed without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and to allay all the ſmarting paines of it, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the joint water or changing of the colour of the wound, ſwellings, or things about it. Other ſuch accidents may be ſoon mended, if the reſtleſneſs of the wound be allayed, then all the reſt will ſoon be mended.</p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:106818:144"/>
                  <p> The proceſs is thus: Take the brown Ointment, cover a tent with it, thruſt it in near to the bottom; but if it be a ſtab, then convey it into with the ſiringe: then take the Opodeldoch, and apply it thick and broad, ſo that all places may be covered a hand breadth about the wound, and to tye it: place the party into a warm bed, miniſter to him a ſpoonful of Roſe water, or Barnet water, and ſix grains of the Pill Anodyne; half an hour after let him have of the ſame pill in a convenient vehicle, of four grains: ſtay an hour, and ſee whether the patient taketh his reſt, if he doth, then let him reſt; if not, then give him four grains more of that Anodyne, and tarry an hour and a half. This muſt be iterated till the party ſleepeth, which will he at the third or fourth time.</p>
                  <p>When he ſleepeth, then cover him warm, not too hot, but as much as he is able to endure: then in his ſleep he <note place="margin">Doſe of the Anodine confection.</note> will ſweat very much: if he awakneth after five, ſix, ſeven, or eight hours, then doubtleſs all his pains, together with the anger, heat, cold, and wound diſeaſe will be gone, and the party refreſhed.</p>
                  <p>Fear not that the ſaid Confection will endanger any way the party; for it may ſafely be uſed from twenty to twenty five grains.</p>
                  <p>Some Surgeons uſe cool things to wound diſeaſes, as the <note place="margin">Abuſe.</note> juice of Cicuta, and of hyſſciamus, the which they apply to the wounded member, of this I cannot approve; becauſe theſe things cool the wound ſo much, that it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any true temper of healing. Theſe uſually cauſe the Cramp, which they naturally uſe to do. Coolers are not proper for wounds. It is a better way to ſhorten the pains of wounds, than to ſeek waies to have them prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>THere is another ſimptom incident to Wounds, the name <note place="margin">Tickling in the wound.</note> of it I have not yet told. I have ſeen it often, and found it in my practick, that wounded parties have felt great heat and burnings in their wounds, which when it was gone, it was as if many worms were crawling in the wound, whereby they felt great pains: aſſoon as that pain was gone, the heat returned, and then the other tickling came in the place of that; and thus the one gave way to the other.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is ſtrange, this being ſo dangerous a ſimptome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both poor and rich were ſpoiled, and many dyed of, ſhould be ſo little known among Surgeons, and ſo little of it extant in print, being it is uſually incident to ſuch wounds, that are in dangerous places. Some that knew this ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, called it Prunella or Brayn, for no other reaſon, but becauſe it is like to that Prunella, which befals the throat.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:106818:145"/>
                  <p> That expert Philoſopher <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> writeth <note place="margin">Why called Prunella.</note> that he had ſeen a patient; which was mightily troubled with the Prunella in the wound, inſomuch that a kind of a thick skin like a ragg could be pulled of the wound, fuſt like the skin that is peeled off the tongue of one that is troubled with the Prunella in his throat. I beleeve him; but I rather marvail, how the party held out, and was not quite ſpoiled. I never ſaw it ſo much in any parties wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, but he either dyed of, or elſe the joint or member was gone and loſt. But God be thanked, that where ever that ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was known, and proper medicines were applied, ſuch wounded parts were for the moſt recovered.</p>
                  <p>How and by what ſigns this Prunella in the wound is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <note place="margin">Signes.</note> and known, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> A wound which gathers no matter in its due time, but keeps very dry, without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then it ſignifieth a Prunella, a ſtrong coming on of it.</p>
                  <p>If the wound on the top beateth much, and ſometime it weepeth, or ſome moiſture it hath, then is the condition of it the worſe.</p>
                  <p>If the wound looketh red, like dryed or <hi>Bartholomes</hi> beef, and the lips of it turn about and are hard, it is a ſign of the Prunella, and a forerunner of a wound diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>A wound being on a perrilous place, yieldeth a grayiſh matter like ſlime, after the fourth, ſixth, eighth or ninth day, and it ſettleth cloſe to the wound, and will not be cleanſed, unleſs by forcible means, and the wound alſo looketh round about like a skin, and the patient alſo is hot, then is it a ſure ſign of a Prunella.</p>
                  <p>If a great muſcle be wounded, and the joint alſo be ſhrewdly hurt, and that wound is loth to afford any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides that there is a rank ſmel in the wound; it is a ſign of a Prunella.</p>
                  <p>In other wounded parties theſe following ſigns are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: <note place="margin">Other ſigns.</note> the party is ſtill deſirous to drink, is coſtive, and troubled with fluſhing heats. His urine and ſtools and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be little informed: if the urine be red, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſignifieth a Prunella to be at hand, and ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a wound diſeaſe is at hand.</p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:106818:146"/>
                  <p> Note; two, three, or more ſimptoms do meet in a wound, and appear all at once: it hapneth alſo that a wound is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dry, yeilds no matter but onely a little water, its lipps are hard and turned outward, are thick and red, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout disformed and indiſpoſed, and a ſlyme in it, no great heat and pain the patient feeleth.</p>
                  <p>Further note; if the wound be in an outer part, (for that about the bodies bulk is of another nature) and the party feeleth panting and pulling pains in that joint or part, it is a ſign of the cold fire, which uſually hath its cauſe from the Prunella: if it be not timely oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cure of ſuch wounds, note; If Prunella be <note place="margin">Cure.</note> diſcerned and known in a wound, by ſome of the ſaid ſigns, then the patient in the firſt place muſt be phlebotomized, as you ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
                  <p>It would be well if it could conveniently be, that a vein were opened under the tongue; for if a party be troubled with Prunella, it is ſooneſt diſcerned by the throat: and ſo it will ſoon ſhew it ſelf in the wound alſo, if it was in the mouth or throat: at which ſome Surgeons are eſtranged, and others do ſlight it: but no ſport for the poor pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>After phlebotomizing, take water of Salarmoniack, mingle it with half as much of Roſe Vinegar, make it warm, ſiringe the wound with it, if it may be done conveniently: afterward uſe this following Ointment to the wound or ſtab: Take of well ſcummed Honey ℥ 4, Vinegar of Roſes and of Juniper, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 1, phlegme of Vitriol ℥ ſs, mingle theſe, make an Unguent of and uſe it; and apply a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive plaiſter without about the wound, but on the wound you are to put a ſtiptick plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>But if the wound be very angry, then the following La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vament is to be uſed: Take of Roſe vinegar lb 3, of Myrrh ℥ 2, mingle theſe and let it boil together for an hour, then ad to it of Camphore <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 1, of Saltpeter ℥ ¼, theſe muſt be well beaten: dip cloths in it, wring them out, lay them four doubled and warm to the wound, let them be big and broad enough; but the wound muſt be covered firſt with a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106818:146"/> good plaiſter before the cloths be applied: if theſe grow cold, then apply other warm ones, and this muſt be itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo long, till the wound be well warmed, then apply a ſtiptick plaiſter,</p>
                  <p>If a wound by theſe be brought to a good paſs, and <note place="margin">Signs wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is known a wound to return right.</note> ſheweth a true and good ſign, then go no further on with theſe medicines: then you are to take good wound Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtiptick plaiſters: But how you ſhall know that a wound returns to a right tune, it is thus: The patient as well as the wound altereth: and the beſt ſign whereby to know it is, when there is no more pain in the wound, and looks ruddy, and is ſoft and tender.</p>
                  <p>The patient muſt take heed of drinking of wine as much as of poiſon, and to ſhun all meats ſeaſoned with ſpiſces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumatical. Let him drink Barley water, wherein muſt be diſſolved prepared Saltpeter, (of which hath been ſpoken above) to five pound of water you are to take half a dram of the ſaid Saltpeter, it will allay his heat, as well that in the wound as that in his body.</p>
                  <p>About the dreſſing of his wound, and the applying of the medicines, you are to do it in that manner, as you heard above about wounds which were exiccated by the Suns heat.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe in my judgement may be enough diſcerned, that it is of great concernment, that a ſimptom in a wound be well known, then it will fall the eaſier to cure ſuch wounds. It is moſt certain, that theſe ſimytoms in wounds will by no means admit of any greaſie medicines. Now thoſe that do not know it, and go on in their old waies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their wound ointments and plaiſters, theſe will do little good, nay rather do miſchief. There ignorance is in fault, why ſo many wounded parties looſe their lives; eſpecially if the wound be in the head, or any other perrilous part: and when ſuch Surgeons have done their beſt, it is at the leaſt (God bleſſe patients) to the loſſe of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded member.</p>

                  <p>In caſe you are to go into the Country with it, then is it better to keep this ſublimate in a powder, and carry it not diſſolved. And coming to your patient, you may diſſolve it in Roſe water: and in caſe you cannot have neither Roſe water, nor Aqua Nenupharina, then take freſh Well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which for a need may ſerve the turn, eſpecially in a Campe, where Prunella uſually is brief among Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>One rare thing more I muſt relate, <hi>viz.</hi> the phlegme of <note place="margin">Verdigriece is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous here.</note> Vitriol, or Vitriol it ſelf, is very good for ſuch wounds, whereas Verdigriece is very hurtful to them, though both are made of Copper.</p>
                  <p>The wounds and the medicines differ here in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: the one affecteth wounds, the other diſſafects them: or the one is a friend, and the other an enemy unto them, &amp;c.

                  <p>CRamp is a dangerous ſimptome, eſpecially in Head wounds, in the neck, throat, &amp;c. where wounds are in dangerous places, there the Cramp is the moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Cold cauſeth the Cramp in a wound, either by that cold <note place="margin">Cauſe of wound Cramps.</note> which from the raw ayr is come into, or elſe the patient was kept too cold. It is moſt certain, aſſoon as the arteries and white veins have felt but the leaſt cold, preſently ſhrink upward, and cauſe the Cramp. Therefore the Surgeon ought to have a care, that when he is about to dreſſe the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106818:147"/> party, to let the wound not be open too long, but dreſſe and bind it preſently, go not beyond the allowed time of dreſſing: and the patient muſt be looked to, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no fault in fretting and vexing at one thing or other. There are other cauſes of the Cramp which we now paſs by.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cure of the Cramp, note; if you diſcern <note place="margin">Cure in head wounds.</note> the Cramp in a Head wound, then alwaies annoint the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients back and neck with proper oiles, of which in the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Head wounds I made ſo often mention of, <hi>viz.</hi> you are alwaies to annoint his back and neck with the oyle of Cammomil, of the oyl of Lumbrici terreſtres, &amp;c.

                  <p>But if the Cramp be in a wound of an outer joint or part, <note place="margin">Cure of the outer parts.</note> where you ſuſpect ſome ſinewes be hurt, then mix your wound ointment with ſome of the red oyl of Turpentine, and apply upon a thin ſtiptick plaiſter. Annoint round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the wound with Tile oyl, or with diſtilled oyl of Bayes, and bind him warm. And in caſe the Cramp will not yeild to theſe means, and is on an outer part, as hand or foot, then foment the wound with warm Lye made of Beech or Oak aſhes, wherein are boiled Cammomil flowers, or Saint Johns-wort: Being thus bathed or fomented for half an hour, and is well warmed, then preſently dreſſe it, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Cramp will ceaſe. But take heed you do not cauſe the Cramp to return, and let the patient alſo be warned of it hereby.</p>

                  <p>Touching Palſie, Apoplexie, &amp;c my intent is not to write much of it, being it concerneth Phyſitians more than Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. But whereas the Cramp is commonly a cauſe and forerunner of the Gout, Palſie, and ſuch like ſimptoms; there ſeems a neceſſity to lye upon a Surgeon, to have ſome judgement of it, that the better he may oppoſe and cure it, therefore I could not chuſe but to give an hint of it.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing better to allay this ſimptom, than a well <note place="margin">Cure.</note> rectified ſpirit of Vitriol: I muſt confeſs there are ſeveral pretious waters; powders, &amp;c. good againſt the Palſie: I I reject none of theſe, but this I hold to be none of the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Vitriol is made thus: Take crude Vitriol which is pure and green, put it in a coated glaſs body, ſet it in an <note place="margin">To make Spirit of Vitriol.</note> Oven into the open fire, apply a Receiver, and lute it well: let your firſt fire be gentle, encreaſe the fire by degrees, get over all the phlegme, when the retort hath been red hot a good while, and no more water comes over, then let the fire go out, and let it be cold.</p>
                  <p>That phlegme which is come into the Receiver, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that body, in which is the ſpirit of Vitriol, for he is not in the Colcotar as ſome ſuppoſe; becauſe in that there is no more ſpirit, but a meer oyl: for if you take that ſpirit of Vitriol, which is made of the ſaid Colcotar, and you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract all its ſpirits in a glaſs body, then on the bottom you will find nothing but a corroſive oyl of Vitriol: whereby we ſee that no ſmall fault is committed herein; for the one is not comparable to the other in its vertue.</p>
                  <p>That ſpirit of Vitriol is pure and clear, like rock water, is acide and not heavy, and it is made thus: Take that phlegme you have received in the Receiver, let it evaporate in Balneo Mariae, on the bottom you will find the ſpirit of Vitriol; abſtract it in ſand a ſecond and third time, in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembick, the oftner the better: if any phlegme ſtayed with it, the ſame you may ſeparate at any time. And if you
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106818:148"/> will have it yet better, then put to it half as much of ſpirit of Wine, put it into a doubled glaſs body, lute it well, ſet it in Sand for a moneth into digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Spirit of Vitriol, which hath no corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding quality, and may ſafely be uſed; and ſpecially it is a ſoveraigne thing for the Head, when an Apoplexie, Palſie, &amp;c. is feared: and if this Spirit be mingled with Magiſtene of Pearles and Corals, then nothing comparable unto it, for the ſaid diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>That Spirit thus mingled may be given to thoſe, that are <note place="margin">The uſe of this Spirit.</note> troubled with a wound diſeaſe, or with a Prunella: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth and corobrateth the inward parts, principally the head and heart. It ſerveth alſo for a pretious vulnerary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The uſe of it is, to be taken faſting four five or ſix drops in one ounce of diſtilled water of Stellaria: but the ſoveraigneſt is, that graſs green oyl of Vitriol; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it cannot be had every where, I forbear to ſpeak any more of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of conſumed, withered or updryed Wounds and Members, how Surgeons ought to deal with them.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Withering, is a Symptom which is incident to joints wounded, commonly to armes or leggs: as much as my experimental knowledge will afford, I ſhall faithfully communicate it.</p>
                  <p>This withering or conſuming is eaſily diſcerned, becauſe <note place="margin">From whence this withering comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> the skin on the outer member looks blacker, than that on the found member; the cauſes thereof are ſeveral: either when muſcles, ſinews, joints are wounded by a fall, blow, thurſt, &amp;c. there may be an external cauſe of it, though not any wound hapned to that part: as a cold humor falling into, or other diſeaſes, be it in the ſhoulder, hip, knee, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:106818:149"/>
                  <p> An Ariditie comes thus alſo: a parry being wounded, and by the Surgeons neglect the joint water did run too <note place="margin">Exiccation <hi>Adridum Membrum.</hi>
                     </note> long. this expert Surgeons call <hi>Membrum aridum,</hi> or an exiccation. For the joint water is a food, whereby all joints and members are ſuſteined. Now if that joint water did run too long, then thereby that part was bereaved of its natural humor, without which it cannot ſubſiſt, it being ſo, how can it chuſe but to decreaſe and conſume.</p>
                  <p>The condition of this joint water is like a tree, which is <note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> opend at the prack in the ſpring, whoſe ſap runneth out where it is cut, and ſo the tree withereth and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, and cannot be recovered. So if the joint water be run thus long, whereby that member is dryed up, and grown hard, ſtiff and inflexible, then Surgeons beſtow their pains in vain about ſuch cures: can do no more to it but to allay the pains that are ſtill in it. But if it be not gone too farre, then be not affraid to fall on the cure, and be helpful unto nature.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral cauſes of this witheredneſs, all of them <note place="margin">Cauſe of this Aridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> I ſhall not relate, one in general I will name, touching the occaſion of the up-drying.</p>
                  <p>That updrying for the moſt part comes from an oppila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that member, be that cauſed from what it will, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from pains, diſeaſes or woundings. For where there are great pains in a member, which have held a long time, then it comes to an updrying; becauſe that ſick member cannot digeſt that food which Nature afforded, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an oppilation in that member; no marvail then if it withereth.</p>
                  <p>It falls out alſo, when a member is wounded very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there may be incident there ſuch an Ariditie, becauſe the natural balſam hath not its true courſe, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Nature to skip over the wound, and that which runs amiſſe, doth not go well. There may alſo fall a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to a member, which though it be not wounded, yet it may be obſtructed, and ſo cauſeth an exiccation.</p>
                  <p>More cauſes could be quoted of ſuch updryings, but it is needleſs to do it, becauſe their cures differ very little: for Acidities cauſed either by a fall, blow, thruſt, or by any
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106818:149"/> other occaſion, all theſe are comprehended under one cure. Thoſe cold witherings by a ſhot, fall, &amp;c. whereby great pains, and conſequently a conſumption of that member is cauſed; that hath a peculiar cure, differing but a little from the other: it may be ſaid of the reſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>Touching ſuch cures, we will firſt of all ſpeak of that, which Surgeons call <hi>Aridum membrum,</hi> cauſed by the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the joint water, you muſt conceave, that I do <note place="margin">Cure of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudum mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum.</hi>
                     </note> not ſpeak here of an aridity, which is come unto an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity; for that which one neither knoweth, nor is able to cure, why ſhould he write of it. I will ſpeak here only of a conſumed member which is not gone too far, where there is yet great hope of its recovery: Do it thus.</p>
                  <p>Take head, feet, lungs, and liver of a Goat, or of a ſheep, or Calfes gather, cleanſe the head and feet well from hairs, wool, &amp;c. put theſe together into a great pot, put alike quantity to it of water and white wine, let it boil that all the bones fall off from the fleſh, throw away the bones, the reſt cut ſmall, put it into that liquor it was boiled in, boil it again to a maſh: with this liquor the patient muſt be fomented as hot as he can endure it. But in caſe the withered member could not conveniently be bathed, then ſpread that maſh on a thick cloth, apply it like a Cataplaſm, as hot as the patient can endure it: aſſoon as that groweth cold, then apply another of the ſame, as warm as he can endure it. That which was uſed muſt ſtill be put into the pot, that you may not want ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for Cataplaſmes. This muſt be continued ſo long, till the patient confeſſeth that it hath warmed his member very well; this warmth may hold half an hour or more: which being done, then take the following Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, annoint the withered member at a coal fire, do it downward, ſtill warming one hand after the other, ſo long till the ſaid member be warmed wel throughly; then lay on it a plain plaiſter, made of Wax and Hoggs greaſe, that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the patient muſt be kept warm: forbear to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oxycroceum or other hot plaiſters. Go on with the former ſo long, till you ſee and perceave that the member is at a mending hand, and getteth ſtrength.</p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:106818:150"/>
                  <p> When you perceave that all the pain is gone, and that member beginneth to prove again, then uſe other Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſhrinkings and updryings; which are found at the Receipt for ordinary Conſumptions and witherings: all the skill lyeth herein, to ſtay the conſuming, and to get to the member its natural nouriſhment, which being brought to paſs, then you may eaſily go on with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Ointmunt above named againſt withered members is thus: Take Cranes greaſe, Foxes greaſe, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 2, greaſe of a young Hogg ℥ 1 ſs, mingle theſe together, make an Ointment, and uſe it as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>Reader out of theſe you may gather, what the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals are of my cure about exiccated members, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccation though it be a withering, yet it differs from other exiccations in the cure. For the medicines uſed here, are not of hot qualities, as thoſe are, which they uſe to other withered members. Now this difference not being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of thoſe which undertake ſuch cures, how can it be otherwiſe but that many patients are ſpoiled and utterly und one.</p>
                  <p>I have much read, ſeen, and heard of withered members, and made uſe alſo of ſuch medicines, that were uſual then, but afteward finding better, I left the other: ſome uſed to whip the dryed member with Juniper twigs, or Horſe tayles, or with Nettles; others rubbed the place with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, &amp;c. others annointed the party at a good fire, others uſed Cupping glaſſes, others uſed Fomentations, &amp;c. all theſe wayes I do not condemn, becauſe my ſelf made uſe of ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>I will inpart unto you my way, with the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>I hold the fleſh of every ſound body hath its growth from abundance of blood and natural humidity: my chiefeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour was, to imitate Nature herein, and to reſtore fleſh to a withered member: and to convey blood and food to it, by rarifying the ſame, by ſtirring and monving it, now by the lifting up the hand, then by hanging it down: in which way the blood is made to come forward and backward, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106818:150"/> by ſtroaking it may be lead further. To which end I took in hand ſuch a withered member, and ſtroaked it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not upward, annointing each part thereof with Wound Ointment, all downward, and ſtroaked the blood and humidity down to the member, in the manner of milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, afterward rubbing the member ſo long, till the very marrow in the bone was warmed thereby, at which work my hands alſo were heated. This ſtroaking downward to the hand or feet I continued for an hour, bringing the blood into the fingers or toes, and forced the blood to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts as much as I could, inſomuch that the toes or fingers began to ſwell from the abundance of blood. After this ſtroaking I applyed a warmed Oxycroceum, well and thick ſpread, laid it on gently only to keep to the part, and let it have ayr and room enough, for the blood and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humidity to come unto. That member I bid the patient alwaies to hang it down, not upward, that the blood may the eaſier get into. I annointed the party twice a day, which ſaveth toyling to the party: when the member be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to grow again, then the party felt no pain when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. That witheredneſs cauſed by a fall and not by a fracture, I have annointed twice a day: if a member did conſume away, by reaſon of a cold or other ſimptom, then I annointed it four times more, than if it had been cauſed by a fracture. If a hand or foot was ſwelled, but the part above was not ſwelled, I liked it well, then I knew my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would not be ill beſtowed: when that member felt a tickling or tingling, it was a ſign of healing; and when that member at the undreſſings grew warm, and the veins looked blew, then I proceeded in the cure. It fell out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that a great pain was come into a hand or foot, which did not much trouble me, becauſe it was frequent with me to have ſuch caſes, for that pain upon ſlighter proceedings paſſed away: after that I went on with rubbing and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, and with Gods bleſſing the cure was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

This is uſed as the other was above related, about withered mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The poulteſſe above mentioned made of a Sheep or Calfes Gather, is needleſs here: and uſe here Oxycroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, inſtead of the plaiſter made of Wax.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſpeak here of faults, ordinarily committed; <note place="margin">Abuſe.</note> They uſually take <hi>Gummi Euphorbium</hi> to Ointments againſt withered members: which is here both uſeleſs and hurtful. For it conſumeth all natural heat in that member which is annointed with it, it dilateth and dryeth up the skin, which ought not to be at any withered or conſumed member.</p>
                  <p>Theſe men ſuppoſe becauſe that Gum is hot, therefore it is good here, when it is no ſuch matter. True, hot things ought to be uſed in ſuch caſes, but thoſe hot things muſt have a moiſt quality alſo, to open the opilations of that member, a contrary quality ſheweth here that Gum.</p>
                  <p>Many other things could be quoted here, to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſumed members, but I wave them, being they are uſual and known ſimptoms.</p>
                  <p>But the exiccation of a member is not known ſo well, how it ought to be cured, many abuſes are committed in its cure, and many dangers are cauſed by ignorant Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I ſhall be the more exact in the deſcription of ſuch cures, the rather, becauſe ſuch exiccation may befall a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which was not wounded, nor bereaved of its humiditie by the joint waters running. A hot chollerick humor may fall into a member or joint, whereby ſuch exiccating heat may be cauſed, natural moiſture exhauſted, whereby a member conſumeth away. For ſuch caſes the ordinary Unguent againſt ſhrinkings are naught, making the caſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe than better.</p>
                  <p>There are other means found againſt withered members, as hot Baths or Pepoirs, &amp;c. Some Unguents, Plaiſters, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quavitae's, &amp;c. There are alſo Topical medicines, <hi>viz</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſticum,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106818:151"/> gathered in <hi>Aprill,</hi> when <hi>Soll</hi> entreth <hi>Aries,</hi> and <note place="margin">Other means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered parts.</note> Ellebore niger, and the like, which ſometimes prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. There are medicaments alſo, which for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may be uſed inwardly at the increaſe of the Moon: but theſe are good againſt ordinary conſumed members, but not againſt exiccated ones: as the Paracelſian Water made of Bloodwort, which I have made uſe of, and found it to do good.</p>
                  <p>Such like things are ſucceſſefully uſed againſt withered members; but this order ought to be kept alſo which you heard given about conſumptions or ſpoiled members. To ſpeak really, the Unguents are not ſo much regarded, as their true preparation and careful application, to work them ſtrongly into the place affected. Therefore let Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons uſe, what they have learned, and known in their practick, applying things duely and diſcreetly; therein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the chiefeſt part of their judgement.</p>
                  <p>Note; As long as a wound is not healed, and great pains are in it, a Surgeon will do little good, unleſs the pains in the wound be removed. In like manner if a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be out of joint, the ſame muſt firſt of all be well ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; if you do not ſo, then your cure is in vain: Nature deſires to be unhindred in her courſe. If in this manner you be carefull about a wound, that no pain be cauſed, nor any joint water running be obſtructive, then the leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be about the conſumption of that member.</p>
                  <p>I cannot chuſe but to reveal a Secret, very good againſt all manner of conſumptions of members, none comparable <note place="margin">A Secret for all Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</note> unto it: but my expreſſions will be according to this Art, to which every one muſt take his courſe, and thoſe that knows to work with fire will agree with me. For it is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal medicine againſt all conſumptions, it opens pours and obſtructions in one day more, than other Unguents will do in a whole moneth; it purgeth ſinews, which of neceſſity muſt be done here.</p>
                  <p>Take of fixed Allom ℥ 4, I mean not crude ſharp or drawing Allom, but the mild and ſoft Allom which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of its own earth; mingle with it diſſolved or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106818:152"/> Salt, very purely beaten, three times as much; put it in a pot or other veſſel, lute it well, keep out all ayr, ſet it in a reverberatory, put fire to it of the fourth degree, the flames muſt beat upon twelve houres long, all muſt be red hot, then let it cool; take it out, open it, the matter which you find on the bottom, caſt into four quarts of Well water, it will diſſolve, that which doth not diſſolve, keep and dry it, put it in a glaſs; pour on it Alcool vini, (which is an Aquavitae diſtilled ſubtilly from all phlegme, ſo that being put in a veſſel, and kindled, that all goeth away with the flame, no liquor ſtaying behind) let it be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two fingers deep about it, and ſo keep it for uſe: when you are to uſe it, then mingle ſome of it with Oyl of Bayes, or others, your Ointment is made of, annoint the conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med member with it once or twice, no matter whether the Moon be new or at the full: this annointing will make the memher ſwell a little, but no pain at all it cauſeth: this being done, then go all the conſumed member over, the member and joint will recover its former ſtrength: keep that member warm, let it take no cold.</p>
                  <p>I tell you that this Seeret is ſo effectual, working upon all manner of opilations of joints; it will help alſo a Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, <note place="margin">A Secret for the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atica.</note> be it cauſed by heat or by cold, of a ſhort or a long ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>My intent was not to reveale that Secret againſt the Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, which followeth; but having ſuch a near affinity with the former, for the publick good ſake, I will reveale it.</p>
                  <p>Take the foreſaid Water, from which the foreſaid Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſeparated, make it warm, rub the hip bone well with it; then take the above ſaid Powder prepared, mingle it with Oyl of Bayes, make an Unguent, and annoint the affected place with it once a day, and do it for two daies: then take of the Water, where that matter was ſeparated from one part, of Vervain and Centorie <hi>ana</hi> three parts; boil theſe in a ſufficient quantity of Water for a bath, let the party be fomented with four or five times, for one or two hours, (that muſt be in the decreaſe of the Moon) then is it enough. Whileſt the patient is in that ſtove, let
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106818:152"/> this following drink be prepared for him: Take of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnus Benedictus ℥ 1, of Calmus ℥ ¼, Flowers of Centorie ℥ 1 ſs, Wormwood ℥ ¼, Cinnamon ℥ ¼, pour upon theſe ſix quarts of Wine, let him drink of it, and no other; or a very little of Barley Water, in caſe the party be very dry; Thus the Sciatica will ſoon paſs away, make no doubt of it: though the hip were out of joint, it will ſoon turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again to its right place, without any further purging, fomenting, wood cures and ſuch like, which are otherwiſe made uſe of in that caſe, though to little purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus I cloſe this third part of Symptoms, let no man i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that I have written of all Symptoms, becauſe there are many which have not been touched at all, neither was it my intent to do it. But theſe are the chiefeſt, and of greateſt concernment: he that knoweth theſe aright, and can handle them well, he may eaſily deal with the reſt; if ſo be he have judgement in Surgery.</p>

               <head type="sub">This Fourth Part is called the Book of Cookery.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, it is well known, and found it ſo perhaps by your own experience, that a bad Cook may ſpoile good Meats, over or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeaſoning them, though in themſelves they be good and wholeſome, yet by his bad cooking may be very unwholeſome: and on the other ſide Meats that in themſelves are unpleaſant and unwholeſome, may be dreſſed ſo that they may ſafely be eaten. Even ſo is it with Medicaments, and thoſe that prepare them: For Medicines which in themſelves are good and uſefull, are by thoſe which are to prepare them, made peſtiferous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to be uſed: on the other ſide there are ſome Druggs, which in themſelves are naught and poiſonous, may in their
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106818:153"/> preparation be ſo rectified, that they prove wholeſome and effectual Medicaments.</p>
               <p>Therefore thoſe that profeſs ſuch an Art, as to prepare Medicaments, muſt do it ſo, that their compounded Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>caments may be proper and ſafely uſed to Wounds, Sores, Ulcers, Fiſtulaes, Cancers, and that their Medicaments may agree with Wounds, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In conſideration hereof, I would not could not intermit, to annexe to my practick of Surgery this fourth Part, which for ſome reaſons I call the Book of Cookery. And that Novices in Surgery may know how to deal in Salves, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Vulnerary Potions, Ointments, &amp;c. the which to do I am the more moved thereunto, becauſe in the precedent parts I named ſome Ingredients, but did not ſet down the compoſition of them, nor how they were to be prepared, and directed the Reader to this fourth Part.</p>
               <p>Courteous Reader, do not think, that I will write of ſuch things here, which are known all the world over, as how Oyl of Roſes, Oyl of Cammomil, and ſuch like, are to be made; which would not only raiſe the Book to a great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, but would be needleſs alſo and ſuperfluous: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I give only hints of Plaiſters made of raw Druggs, is the reaſon, becauſe their compoſitions are common and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known. Other things which do not lye ſo open as yet, and their preparations, are not known to every one, theſe I will reveale and impart faithfully. And then will I ſpeak of things alſo, which want corrections, which though they be good, yet have ſome bad things alſo, for which cauſe they ought not to be miniſtred unto patients, unleſs their good and pure things be firſt ſeparated from their impure parts; and that is commonly called correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when a harmleſs thing is put to that which is dangerous, which is a great fault to do ſo, and be warned that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Never made uſe of any diſtilled Wound-Balſams, neither <note place="margin">Diſtilled wound balſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams.</note> do I greatly eſteem them, becauſe uſually they are too hot; and are not only dangerous in Head wounds, and uſeleſs in other wounds, but alſo by reaſon of their too violent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating quality, are poiſonous to Head wounds.</p>
                  <p>But if ſinews are cut in a member, there I praiſe the red Oyl of Turpentine, and hold it to be very good. <note place="margin">Uſe of redd oyle of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Surgeons are accuſtomed to uſe Wound Balſams to all Wounds, which I do not approve of, adviſe them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forbear, though many pretious Ingredients come to their compoſition, yet they are made too hot in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling.</p>
                  <p>I like and approve better of Wound Oyles, and of Wound Ointments, than of Wound Balſams; I know no <note place="margin">Wound-oyles wound ointments.</note> other difference between them, but onely that the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſomewhat thicker, and may more conveniently be carryed into other places, for that reaſon I rather uſed Ointments for eaſier carriage ſake, and when I had uſe for them, I diſſolved and applyed them warm, by letting them run into the wound.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo this difference about Wound Ointments: ſome <note place="margin">Clear ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentine</note> Wounds are better pleaſed with this Ointment, and others are diſſafected unto it: which may be ſeen by that, when an Ointment cauſeth pains in a Wound; for that reaſon I approve not ſo well of clear Turpentine, to be uſed thus crude into the Wounds, eſpecially to Head wounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it paineth them. The dry Turpentine, or the Gum of Larix is better for this purpoſe, if it be well waſhed.</p>

                     <p>Note about Wound Ointments; there are ſo many
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106818:154"/> things uſed hereunto, that they hardly can be named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Gumms of trees.</note> Surgeons hold this or that, and as many heads ſo they varie herein. Several ſorts of Hearbs, Roots, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Seeds, Fruits, are uſed hereunto; alſo all ſorts of Gums, of Apple trees, Cherry trees, Juniper trees, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Frankincenſe, &amp;c. Balſam of Apples, &amp;c. Who is able to relate all?</p>
                     <p>What matter it is, how many things are uſed to Wound Ointments, as long as the Ingredients are good. It is not ſo great a skill to heal wounds, becauſe one Salve or Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if good, may heal many wounds, though one wound is not healed ſo ſoon as the other, yet it will be done in due time. The chiefeſt thing is, that a Surgeon have judgment in theſe things, and be able to diſcern when any ſimptom is coming, that it may timely be oppoſed or prevented.</p>
                     <p>Many Surgeons uſe theſe Gums, Bdellium, Opopanax, <note place="margin">Bedellium Opopanax Serapium.</note> Serapium, and ſuch like, for to dreſſe wounds withal, of which I do not approve: becauſe they are of too ſtrong an atractive quality, which ought not to be uſed to wound Ointments, being more dangerous with their too much drawing.</p>
                     <p>Other Surgeons make uſe of Unguentum Apoſtolicum, which is an abſurd thing, if it ſhould be uſed to freſh wounds whereof I ſpeak here; ſuch like groſs Compoſitions, uſually ſome made much of, I could not forbear to give warning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Wound Ointments which to this day I made uſe of, are few and plain, but are well prepared, which I will faithfully impart to you.</p>

                     <p>There is no other difference between Wound Unguents and Wound Oyls, onely their thickneſs, the one is thinner than the other; and to the one are uſed as many Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents as to the other: if you take to the ſaid Hearbs, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ingredients, no Wax or thick ſtuff, but onely Oyles or thin greaſe, then it is only a wound Oyl. But I made more uſe of the Unguents than of the Oyles: the advantage herein is only, that Unguents may more conveniently be carried into other parts of the Land, than the Oyls.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of wound Oyls, and wound Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, I intend not to ſpeak of them all, onely of ſome rare wound Oyls I will ſpeak, to make uſe of them if you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Take pure Turpentine, and no running Raſom ℥ 1 ſs, put and heat it in a pan, then take pulveriſed Amber, put <note place="margin">A good wound Oil.</note> it in by degrees and let it melt, then put to it of Maſtick ℥ ¼, of Frankineenſe ℥ ſs; all theſe being melted and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then take off the pan from the fire, and drop into gently of Linſeed Oyl ℥ 4, ſtir it till it be cold, try on a ſtone with a drop whether it be done well; if it be of the thickneſs of Vernice then is it right, if it be too thin, then let it boil longer, if too thick, then put more of the Oyl to it.</p>
                     <p>Courteous Reader, here you have a wound Oyl of great vertue for deep wounds and ſtabs, if put thinly into. But if you will have theſe Oyls more pleaſant and affected to the wound, then take of that Oyl ℥ 3, of Oyl of Roſes ℥ 2, Fowers of St. Johns wort, and of the blew Flowers of Knotgraſs <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 1; mingle theſe all together, beat them, let them ſtand in the Sun for twenty daies, and keep it for uſe: you may put to it of ſuch wound Hearbs, which you think fit beſt, then will it be praiſe-worthy.</p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:106818:156"/>
                     <p> Let no man be affraid, as if theſe wound Oyls were too ſtrong, by reaſon of the Maſtick, Frankincenſe, Amber, &amp;c. becauſe their burning hot quality goeth away at the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chymiſts know that it is ſo. Theſe are the wound Salves, and wound Oyls I thought good to impart. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not that I give ſo few and ſo plain Receipts. To make Salves, Ointments, and Oyls for wounds, is no great skill; true, theſe are of concernment, and ſo are the application and dreſſing, and not ſo much doth lye in their variety.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes one Simple will heal a wound as well as a great Compound. The judgement in things is of a farre greater concernment, than the variety of medicines. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will make a Compound of Ointments, Oyles, Plaiſters, of many Ingredients, then you muſt know firſt, why you will uſe this or that, and for what; you muſt not go on in it like a blind man, to make an <hi>omnium gatherum</hi> without diſcretion, which many uſe to do. And it is for certain true, that it is more dangerous ſometimes, if but one Simple is uſed, than when a plain Compoſition is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
                     <p>I muſt give one hint more of a thing I have ſaid above, that Galbanum, Opopanax, &amp;c. are not good ro be uſed to Unguents for freſh wounds: I remember that Maſtick, Sarcocolla, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, are frequently uſed for wound Salves and Unguents: theſe are good if uſed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; but if exceeded in, then are they hurtful, and are too hot for wounds: and in caſe any ſimptom is coming into the wound, then are theſe alſo very hurtful; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the wound diſeaſe, and wound Prunella, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccated wounds they are a meer poiſon.</p>
                     <p>And for that reaſon I uſe but little of Maſtick, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, to my wound Unguents, and ſtiptick Plaiſters, and no more than I do know that I muſt needs take, why ſhould I take more of them than there is need: too much and too little ſpoils any thing: wound Unguents &amp; wound Plaiſters, ſhould alwaies ſtand in one temperament. I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that if too much of any of the ſaid Ingredients were taken, that it never brought any good; that fleſh which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106818:156"/> in the healing ſhould come on, they quite burn it away, cauſing the running of the Joint water. It is better the medicines be rather to weak than too ſtrong, and may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be obſerved in wounds that it is ſo, if notice be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve (let it be a warning) how much the wound doth receave of the medicine in digeſting of it, that thereby you may know what diſtance of time you are to keep for the next dreſſing: all this you muſt be ſure of, and not to go by gueſſe, for here it doth not hold, to ſay my Receipt is good, you muſt have judgement both of wounds and of Receipts, whether they affect each other.</p>

                     <p>Courteous Reader, I have made ſeveral mentions of this <note place="margin">Brown Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</note> brown Unguent, and adviſed you to uſe it to wounds, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to joint wounds, aſſoon as you fear in the leaſt manner the coming of any ſimptom into it: I laid the cure <note place="margin">For what uſe?</note> of joint wounds on this Unguent, held it good for all wounds, and counſelled Surgeons to make uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I held it neceſſary to deſcribe it orderly, by reaſon of its great vertue. It preventeth and driveth away all ſimptomes, cleanſeth wounds, and furthereth their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mightily, it keeps off inflamation, oppoſeth forcibly all malignant corroding humors. This Unguent may be boiled to a hardneſs, to make wicks or tents of it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to the bottom of deep wounds or ſtabs, where it melteth by degrees, laying a clean foundation for healing, oppoſing all contrary things.</p>

                        <hi>Of Plaiſters in generall, and in particular of Opodeldoch, ſtiptick and defenſive Plaisters.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS there is a variety of wound Unguents, ſo there is a variety alſo of wound Plaiſters, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Surgery: I cannot diſlike that every one ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto that, what he hath learned, and I know that ſome Surgeons uſe things, which they do not underſtand, and care not for better experimental knowledge.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak my opinion about wound Plaiſters, it is meerly a cover over for a wound, as many do count it no other; but they are of as great concernment as wound Unguents, which run into the wound: for if theſe Plaiſters be well prepared, then they preſerve wounds from many ſimptoms, and are to be highly eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>And do not approve at all of that, when Surgeons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Plaiſters to wounds on dangerous places, made of Wax, Suet, Turpentine, Oyl, &amp;c. In ſome place they hold it a great skill in Surgery, if they can prepare <hi>Emplaſtrum Diachylon,</hi> and apply it to the wound: it helpeth ſuch wounds which hardly deſerve the name of a wound: but in dangerous wounds, where more care and vigilancie is required, it doth no good, to ſay nothing of a worſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>But as I ſaid afore, it is a great matter to have good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in Plaiſters: for an unclean wound is affected
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106818:158"/> with Gum Amoniack, and ſuch like; but to running wounds ſuch Gumms are clean contrary: for that reaſon is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that Surgeons ought to know the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of wounds, and to be ſure with what each wound doth agree: therefore as in former Chapters I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted unto you faithfully the Compoſitions of wound Unguents and of wound Oyls, ſo will I do now alſo, and teach you the compoſing, preparing, and uſing of wound Plaiſters, and will begin with the Plaiſter Opodeldoch.</p>

                     <p>He that will have or make it, muſt be informed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in many things; and he that cannot make it, let him keep to his ſtiptick Plaiſters, and be more vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then he will have good ſucceſs in his cures.</p>
                     <p>Take of Virgins Wax lb 2, of the darkiſh Turpentine lb 1, of Sallade Oyl ℥ 3, note, I ſpeak of the darkiſh Turpentine, becauſe ſome baſe ſhop-keepers ſell Kintrigt Raſom, which is ſoft and running, for Turpentine, whoſe vertue is not comparable unto that of Turpentine.</p>
                     <p>Melt theſe together, and put to it the juice of Celon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, the juice of Oak leaves, the juice of Starwort, and Speedwell, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ 1 ſs, boil theſe and let all the moiſture thereof be conſumed; then put theſe Gums to it, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, Galbanum, Opopanax, clarified with Vinegar, <hi>ana</hi> ℥ ¼, of Colophone ℥ 1 ſs, of Amber ℥ ſs, of Maſtick, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Sarcocolla, <hi>ana</hi>

                  <p>I Have made frequent mention of this <hi>Anodynum Labda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>

                  <p>Take of <hi>Opium Thebaicum</hi> two ounces, cut it into ſmall <note place="margin">Its prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> pieces, and pour unto it of Alcool vini five ounces, put it into a little glaſs body, let it ſtand in a warm place, the Alcool will be tinged, cant it off cleanly, the beſt vertue of that Opium is in that Wine, the remaining feces on the bottom may be flung away.</p>
                  <p>This Alcool muſt be abſtracted in Balneo Mariae, then that Opium appeareth in the bottom of the glaſs, in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Honey; then take the out-queezed juice of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as freſh as you can have them, let it run through a woolen bag to clarifie it; of this juice half an ounce, and of the ſaid Opium half an ounce, mingle it well together, then ad to it of Oyl of Cinnamon ℈ 1, Oyl of Cloves ℈ ſs, of the Magiſterie of Pearles, and of the Magiſterie of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> 2, of Amber ℈ 1 ſs, of Moſch ℈ 1, of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Saffron ℈ ſs, of the extract of Caſtorium, extracted with Aquavitae one dram; mingle all theſe well together, lute the glaſs body, that nothing vapour away, let it be in a warm place in digeſtion twenty dayes: after that time open the glaſs, all that is in it is wholly ready and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, take it out and keep it for uſe.</p>
                  <p>If you will have this Electuary yet better, then you may ad unto of <hi>Tinctura Auri</hi> ℈ ſs; but I was contented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with the above ſaid Receipt.</p>
                  <p>This Electuarium hath extraordinary vertues, for many infirmities, and it may very well be held for a treaſure. It allayeth all raging and beating in wounds, aſſwageth the pains in the head, cauſeth ſweet ſleep, expels the pains in the body, warmeth the inward parts, is a ſtrengthner to the skull, refreſheth the ſpirit, and maketh the party merry, it cauſeth good appetite to eat, refreſheth the head,

                  <p>The doſe of it is from four grains to ſix, eight, twelve and more, as neceſſity ſhall require it, which you ought to take notice of: it may ſafely be uſed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Blood ſtenching in Wounds and Noiſtrils, how the things requiſite thereunto muſt be prepared and uſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ABove have I rejected ſome Blood-ſtenchings, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus, I do not thereby reject or refuſe all Bood-ſtenchings which ordinarily are uſed: I rejected only ſuch Blood ſtenching, performed through Cauteries, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I hold all Blood ſtenching good (except Cauteries and Corroſives) if uſed without danger and prejudice to the party, be they made of what they will: <hi>viz.</hi> of Rye meal, of Mill duſt, Pulmonaria, &amp;c. in brief, all things imbibed and turned to a pap are good to ſtench Bloud; provided it be not a hot matter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe following may lawfully be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> a Carniol ſtone, Haematites, Agat ſtone, Crocus Martis, Bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, ſealed Earth, Earth of Vitriol, in which there is no Alcool left, the ſweet red liquor of Vitriol: in like manner Gum Arabick, Gummi Tragant, the white hair of Hairs, Cotton-wool, Mullipuff, and the like: of Hearbs and Roots tending to that purpoſe, provided they be not of a biting and corroding quality, whereby inflamations in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106818:164"/> Wounds may be cauſed. Expect not many Receipts about Blood ſtenching, I will ſet down only theſe which I made uſe of, and found them to be beſt: he that underſtandeth me well, will eaſily provide for himſelf the like Blood ſtenchers, leaving every one to his own diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>To Bloud-ſtenching I uſe firſt a Plaiſter, which is made thus: Take of Amber half an ounce, of white ſoft Roſin <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſtench blood.</note> one pound, the dark Turpentine four ounces, of Maſtick a quarter of an ounce, of Crocus Martis made in a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratorie three ounces. Of theſe make a Plaiſter in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
                  <p>Take a fourth part of Turpentine, make it very hot, ſtrain the pulveriſed Maſtick and Amber into by degrees, theſe two being melted therein, then put the reſt of the Turpentine to it, and then the Roſin, which in another pot muſt be melting gently; after all that, you put in the Crocus Martis, and then you let it cool, ſo is it ready.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt and chiefeſt Bloud ſtencher, not ſo much by reaſon of the Ingrediences, but by reaſon of the ſingular Manuals which fall out here, as you ſhall have more of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>2. The other piece which is here to be uſed, is this: Take Mullipuff, cut great and ſmall pieces of it, of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thickneſs or thicker, ſome as big as an Egg, and of a fingers length, ſhorter and longer of all ſorts, tye theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces in a paper as hard as you can, and tye them cloſe together, then bind them more harder together with tape, ſo that one piece which was of the bigneſs of an egg, in the binding be no bigger than the little finger: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, preſſe it together with heavy weights, or ſcrew it into a preſſe, where you muſt let it lye for ſome daies, that they may be yet cloſer preſt together, then take them forth, lye them yet more together, and keep them for uſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, you muſt be provided alſo with this Powder: <note place="margin">Blood ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> Take Sheeps blood, let it ſtand till the blood ſeparateth from the water, which is done in one day and night, pour off the water, and put the congealed blood into a pot, ſet
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:106818:164"/> it in a circular fire, like unto a little cement fire, let it ſtand ſo till it be quite dry, it neither ſtinketh nor is of any rank ſent, and being turned to a powder, then is it ready. Take of this prepared blood four ounces, of purely pulveriſed Gum Traganth half an ounce, of Blood wort pulveriſed half an ounce: mingle all theſe, and keep it for uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now if you have any patient whoſe blood you are to ſtench, then firſt note and obſerve carefully, whether when he is angry, the blood will not be ſtaid, unleſs his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be over. The like caſe is when the party hath a parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme on him: otherwiſe you are to do thus: take a little of that powder and caſt it into the wound, and take a piece of the prepared Mullipuff, apply it to the wound; the bigneſs of the Mullipuff muſt be anſwerable to the wideneſs of the wound, yet ſo that it eaſily go into the wound, and not be forced into: therefore ought you be provided with all ſorts of ſuch pieces: then another broad and thin piece muſt be laid on the wound, or elſe Cotton wool, mingled with a little of ſtenching powder, and hold it a little with your hand.</p>
                  <p>Make the place dry with a ſponge round about the wound, and apply the afore written plaiſter to it, ſpread on a bladder, pritty broad and great, ſo that the wound every where be well covered: then take a boulſter preſſe the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cloſe to the wound, and with the binding be made cling unto the skin, then it will receive no more moiſture, and cloſeth the bloud in the wound, and can preſſe forth no where, neither at the ſides, nor below nor above, ſo that the blood is as it were forced to ſtay, and run together and congeal within.</p>
                  <p>Hereby the Reader may eaſily underſtand, that it is a matter of conſequence when you are about the applying of a plaiſter, that you muſt be careful to put away the bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the wound, and that the skin be well dryed: for the dryer the place is, the ſooner the plaiſter clingeth, and the plaiſter ſticking to it, then is the thing for the moſt part holp Have a care that the plaiſter do not get looſe again; and in caſe the wound bleedeth too vehemently, then is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:106818:165"/> that you apply a greater plaiſter upon the firſt, that it may ſtick on a dry place.</p>
                  <p>This Blood ſtenching is very natural, as judicious men may eaſily underſtand, and it is very convenient for a wound; for whither can the blood run, being kept in by that on ſticking Plaiſter, neither can it preſs above through the bladder, and ſo it is forced to ſtay and be ſtenched. Beſides the aboveſaid powder hath a marvailous quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it turneth glutinous, and uniteth with the blood by reaſon of the Gum Tragacanth, and the prepared blood; for that blood alſo uniteth with mans blood, the matter ſwells in the wound, and turns to a ſlyme, as you heard above: and the blood alſo groweth thereby glutinous, and ſo cannot run much.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing is it alſo with the prepared Mullipuff, when it is laid into the wound, it goeth aſunder, ſwelleth to the bigneſs it was at firſt of, ſtoppeth the wound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and that ſwelling is gentle not forcible, without any danger and prejudice to the wound: that may be uſed to all wounds, even to head wounds; ſo the powder alſo may be uſed, provided it do not come too nigh to the naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation.</p>
                  <p>It is not alwaies needful, that ſuch great earneſt be uſed in Blood ſtenchings, neither is it neceſſary to uſe ſuch preſt <note place="margin">When Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipuff is to be uſed.</note> Mullipuffs: underſtand it onely of ſuch wounds which bleed extreamly, where no ordinary means will prevail: the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipuff may be uſed <hi>per ſe</hi> alſo, but you muſt uſe a good deal of it, apply it looſe to the wound, and then to keep it on with a plaiſter: many do uſe it ſo, and they do well therein.</p>
                  <p>There is no man compelled or tyed to the foreſaid pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor to the Mullipuff, you may make a compoſition of your own head of the foreſaid Ingrediences, as you think it beſt. Mingle that powder among pure Cotton wool, uſe it duely, but then I counſell you, not to forget the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which is the chiefeſt thing herein.</p>
                  <p>I made uſe of this way in Blood ſtenching hitherto, and was ready to impart faithfully the ſame unto others, hoping
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:106818:165"/> that if you underſtand me aright, and handle theſe thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rightly, you will doubtleſs have good ſucceſs: onely let me intreat you, not to uſe any Corroſives, that are burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and biting, for reaſons alleadged above.</p>
                  <p>Touching ſpells over wounds, and characters, which are greatly uſed of ſome, to ſtench bleeding thereby: I know <note place="margin">Spells.</note> nothing to ſay of them, and I leave it in its worth. They are meer words and ſigns which are not underſtood of him neither which maketh uſe of them: and what they are like to effect thereby, the ſame I commit to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes things fall out ſtrangely, when the wound is in ſuch a place, where the ſaid plaiſter cannot be applied conveniently, as a party being wounded in the mouth or throat: as ones noſe falleth a bleeding vehemently, then other means muſt be thought upon, as I ſhall tell you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>If one be wounded in a place, where a plaiſter cannot <note place="margin">How to ſtench the blood in the mouth.</note> conveniently be applyed, then ſtench that blood thus: Take of the red liquor of Vitriol, which hath no corroſive quality, one part, and of Gum Arabick a third part to its quantity; mingle theſe, ſpread it on Cotton wool, and endeavour to bring it to the wounded place, it will make the wound draw together, the blood veins will ſhrink, and the blood will be quenched, and all without biting or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding: but you muſt have a care to let the Cotton wool with the matter, lay a while on the wounded place, that it may work upon it: and if it doth not work ſufficiently at the firſt time, then iterate it once more, that the blood may be ſtenched.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame nature is the vehement bleeding at the noſe; <note place="margin">Bleeding at the noſe.</note> here it is not alwaies good to have that bleeding ſtenched pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>tly, eſpecially in cephalical diſeaſes, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by other diſeaſes are ſpent and conſume away by that bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but if that bleeding be ſo violent, that it muſt needs be ſtenched, then proceed thus: Take inſtead of Cotton wool, (of which I made mention above) a little piece of <note place="margin">How to ſtay it.</note> the ſoft dryed and preſt Mullipuff, pull a needle and ſtrong
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106818:166"/> twiſted thred through it, with a great knot on the end of it; the Mullipuff muſt be of that bigneſs, that it may juſt go in at the noiſtrils, cover it with the foreſaid liquor of Vitriol, mingle it with Gum Arabick, thruſt it up with an inſtrument into the noiſtril to the hole which goeth down to the throat; if you do not ſo, you will do but little good, for fear the blood ſhould take its courſe into the throat, therefore the Mullipuff muſt be ſtraight thruſt upward, being it is ſoft and cauſeth no pain. Have a care that the thred, ſtuck thorough the Mullipuff, hang a good deal out of the noſe, that you may pull it out when you have need.</p>
                  <p>Thus a bleeding noſe may eaſily be ſtenched. For ſuch kind of bleeding other means may alſo be uſed, as Saltpeters clothes laid to the neck, inwardly you may help much, as you ſhall here hereafter.</p>
                  <p>If you ſee that the patient hath need to be plebotomized, <note place="margin">Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> and hath need of other medicaments, then let him have them: my intent is here onely, how the bleeding of the noſe is to be ſtenched, though this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſeemeth mean and poor, yet I found it ſtill to be beſt and moſt uſeful: for the Mullipuff ſwelleth in the noſe, and <note place="margin">Mullipuff.</note> obſtructeth the bloods courſe; and the liquor of Vitriol by its conſtipating vertue draweth things together without any danger and prejudice.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant of, that many remedies were ſought <note place="margin">The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trriols li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</note> after for to ſtench the bleeding at the noſe, but they never did much good with it; inſomuch that many bled to death, without help or before they could be helped: I ſpeak no more of it, than what I have found true by experience.</p>
                  <p>There are many good means which ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as precious Stones hanged about the neck, or put into the mouth or hand, or they ſcrath the party with them; or there is a ſingular experiment made of Saltpeter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </argument>
                  <p>TO make Vulnerarie Potions, and to uſe them is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing, and every Surgeon hath his own way which he thinks beſt, which indeed is tollerible: for theſe drinks cannot be rejected, as if they were good for nothing, but are rather to be praiſed, as without which Surgeons ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cannot be, the which I had e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>perience of.</p>
                  <p>But I met with indiſcreet dealings in ſuch potions, that thereby ſome did more hurt than good; whereas if well handled and made, more good can be done by them, than otherwiſe; which moveth me to bring to light, that which I have uſed ſucceſsfully.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may eaſily gather from hence, that it is a matter of great concernment, to keep Vulnerarie Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> a true uſe, and if you ſtick to my order, you will find the abuſes which others commit in the uſe of ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are commonly practiſed.</p>
                  <p>For ſome there are found, which are of opinion that wound hearbs are healing the wounds, therefore it is all one, what hearbs they take, and ſo keep none, or very
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:106818:167"/> little difference between wound hearbs, whereby many a patient is ſpoiled, who can nere be brought to right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And this is the reaſon why ſome hold very little or nothing at all with Vulnerarie Potions, by reaſon of the abuſes that are crept into them, and effect very little with them.</p>
                  <p>And for my yart I eſteem them little or nothing, if mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by ſuch, which underſtand them not: but if they be uſed by expert Surgeons, according unto Art, then I hold it for a thing very neceſſary and helpful, to further the cures of wounds. For I ſpeak it really that through Vulnerarie Potions many malignant ſimptoms can be either oppoſed or prevented; as Fiſtulaes, Cancers, Colloſities, &amp;c. But if this buſineſs be not rightly underſtood, then much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief can be cauſed thereby, as you heard enough of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe following are the wound Hearbs, which I uſed and ſtill uſe to wound Potions: <hi>Viz. Barbula hirci, May</hi> flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, <note place="margin">Wound Hearbs the Author u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wound Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Alkekengi, Pyrola, Cinckfoyle, <hi>Virga Aurea,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwort, Sanicle, Stellaria, Ground Ivi, Speed well, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericon, Nipp, Carduus, Fennel root, <hi>Serpentaria, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temiſa rubra,</hi> Cariophyllata, Salvia, Strawberry leaves, <hi>Biſtorta,</hi> Ellebore niger, Knotgraſs, white and red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Plantain, Savin, Rhubarb, <hi>Tormentilla, Matriſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> Maiden-hair, Tamarisk the hearb, the root of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podie, Liquorice, Vervain, the hearb of Centorie, &amp;c. And I have further made uſe of <hi>Oculi Cancrorum,</hi> Mumia, and <hi>Sperma Cetae.</hi> There are other things beſides theſe, which may be uſed for that purpoſe, of roots, ſeeds, gums; but I made uſe of the things named above; from them I will deſcribe my practick.</p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt thing about Vulnerarie Potions is, to know the vertues and operations of Simples, of which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make your wound Potions; for ſome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients preſs very forward to the wound, appearing in the ſhape of a water, ſo doth <hi>Serpentaria,</hi> Adderwort, and the tke fat hearbs, where great muſcles and other fleſh is wounded, they are good alſo for ſuch wounds, which incline unto exiccation.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:106818:167"/>
                  <p> But ſuch Hearbs are not good for Joint wounds, for <note place="margin">Fat wound hearps for what uſe.</note> whom are more proper, <hi>Artemiſiarubra, Virga Aurea,</hi> &amp;c. Where is to be noted, that aſſoon as Joint wounds are ſafe enough from ſimptoms, then no wound potion to be uſed at all, elſe too much fleſh will be drawn into the wound, Therefore f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t wound Hearbs, which draw much of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous fleſh into the wound, do no good at all to Joint wounds: For they are of that condition, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <note place="margin">Note.</note> preſs unto that place, and bring their humidity into the wound. And if theſe wounds be a little cloſed, ſo that the moiſture cannot preſs through, therefore of neceſſity it muſt ſettle in the joint, which appeareth not till after healing of the wound, in a kind of ſwelling, which though they be not painful, yet cannot be conſumed but in a long time.</p>
                  <p>Therefore my meaning and counſell is, that Vulnerarie potions ſhould no longer be uſed, but as long as any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects appear; and when no more faults appear, and no ſimptoms are feared, then ceaſe with Vulnerarie potions, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them leſs every d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>The Surgeon muſt well obſerve what is proper for a wound, and pleaſant to the patient; for ſome Potions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſome patients better than others, one thing is liked better of ſome than of others, and then ſome Potions are more proper for wounds than others, and according as wounds are qualified, becauſe the one is more fiery than the other; of the ſame condition are patients alſo.</p>

                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:106818:168"/>

                     </gap>l, and whether the wound be in a right poſture or no; for where ever you find any defect, you muſt accordingly prepare your Vulnerarie potions. To make it more plain unto you, if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinews and veins wounded, and the wound makes no haſt to cleanſe it ſelf, then Carioplyllata is very good in that Vulnerarie potion, alſo the <hi>Serpentaria, Tormentilla,</hi> Vervain, Centorie, Sanicle, Fennel root, Rhubarb, &amp;c. as alſo (which indeed is but an ill ſign) when the wound or ſtab is at a ſtand, and will not heal any further, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſtink, then the Cardnus is the beſt hearb for it, as alſo the Nip, Cariophlyllata, Adderwort, Ellebore niger, <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rma Cetae, Oculi Cancrorum,</hi> &amp;c. and of other.</p>
                  <p>Which ought to be well obſerved, becauſe theſe hearbs differ in their operation, for the one is much ſtronger than the other, and ſo ought the leſs to be uſed, as Ellebore ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſtronger than <hi>Dracunculus,</hi> or <hi>Serpentaria,</hi> Adder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, or Veronica; and ſome of theſe hearbs are opilative, as Knotgraſs, <hi>Stellaria,</hi> red Roſes, <hi>Tormentilla,</hi> &amp;c. on the other ſide others are laxative, as Rhubarb, <hi>Helleboras ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> Polypodium, &amp;c. others are diuretical, as Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair, Fennel root, winter Cherries, Rhubarb, <hi>Oculi Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum, Sperma Cetae,</hi> Savin, and Nipp, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this is alſo to be noted, that among theſe Hearbs the one is ſtronger than the other, the one is more diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick than the other, and the one purgeth more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which by all means are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let Students here learn their leſſons better, and not accuſtome themſelves to deal and to handle Wound potions dreamingly, as many do, which care not what Hearb they uſe; if it beareth onely the name of a Vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie potion, then all is well with them. Hence ariſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſes about Vulnerarie potions, whereby they do more hurt than good. I heard them many times boaſt, that they had ſuch wound Hearbs, nothing comparable unto them, but I never regarded them, becauſe they uſed neither judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor diſcretion therein.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:106818:168"/>
                  <p> Of the above named Ingrediences you may order your Vulnerarie potions, and to join together hot and cold hearbs as you ſee fitting; but ſtill look to that, what the condition of the patient, and the neceſſity of the wound requireth.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of their quantity, weight or meaſure, cannot be well ſet down; becauſe one Patient is of a ſtronger na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than another, the one a man, the other a woman; theſe parties ought to be conſidered, and the Vulnerarie potions regulated anſwerably. And to come nearer to the deſcription of Vulnerarie Potions, firſt you muſt note; and it is known unto others alſo, that Vulnerarie potions increaſe the blood more than meats, therefore the better that Potions, the better blood it will make; now every wound receiveth its food from the blood: hence eaſily it may be gathered, if that Potion be prepared of good wound Hearbs, that the wound alſo will the better and ſooner be healed, preſerverh and defendeth them from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral malignant enemies; if ſo be that good order and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et be kept with moderateneſs: therefore endeavour to uſe to ſuch Potions not the meaneſt, but the beſt, however all muſt be ordered as the occaſion of the thing requireth.</p>
                  <p>Touching the cooking and boiling of Vulnerarie Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">Boiling of Vulnerarie potions.</note> therein not one alone but ſeveral waies are uſed: the one boileth them in Wine ſimply, another boils it in Wine in an upſhut veſſel, which is more fit, but not much better, others uſe Waters to it, diſtilled of Hearbs, theſe are not much to be regarded, becauſe the ſalts are not therein which operate moſt; others take theſe Hearbs green with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other addition, putting them in a cloſed Pewter veſſel, ſetting it in a kettle full of water, boile the Hearbs ſo long till the juice be out of the Hearbs, and that drink they uſe; but ſuch Potions are too ſtrong, and but a little of it muſt be uſed at a time. It can be made pleaſant with Cinnamon and Sugar, to pleaſe the patients pallat; all which is left free to every ones diſpoſing, however diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be uſed herein.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth now that I ſet down ſome Receipts for
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106818:169"/> Vulnerarie Potions. It muſt not be underſtood here, that thereby I reject all other Vulnerarie Potions; the Ancients alſo have left behind them ſeveral good Vulnerarie Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they ſet them down ſo upon ſure reaſons: I am onely againſt abuſes, as you often heard me ſpeak of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have leave not only, to make uſe of my Vulnerarie Potions, but alſo of other mens Potions, and all diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſiderately.</p>
                  <p>If you will make a Vulnerarie potion for to uſe it, then <note place="margin">No red Wine to be uſed to wound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> take no red Wine to it, for reaſons known: and ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be uſed mornings faſting, and the party faſt two hours upon, or evenings two hours after ſupper.</p>

                     <p>6. This Compoſition is not known to many, which moved me to impart it, and it is thus: If you fear that there is in a wound or ſtab a looſe piece of bone, proud fleſh, pieces of broken veins, fowl matter or ſuch like, (which uſually hapneth to deep wounds or ſtabs) then take your wound Hearbs, which you intend to uſe, mingle among them a

Of this you muſt not take ſo much, as uſually is taken, becauſe its vertue now is made better and ſtronger: which is to be underſtood of other things alſo, where <hi>Sperma Cetae</hi> is uſed.</p>
                     <p>And this is all what I intended to write of Vulnerarie Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hoping that the Reader hath ſufficiencie of iuſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thence, according to which he may order all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of Vulnerarie Potions.

                     <p>Many may think, when they have peruſed the things I have written concerning Vulnerarie Potions, and ſay; this man uſeth in his Surgerie none but plain Plaiſters and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents: if any one ſhould perſwade himſelf ſo, he may be deceaved. For beſides theſe Vulnerarie Potions, I uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Wound Unguents, Stiptick Plaiſters, Opodeldoch, &amp;c. as good as they may be, and occaſion requireth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is true, that if Vulnerarie Potions are uſed, then the wound needs not ſo much of Unguents, as when none were uſed. Neither do I adviſe, that ſuch Vulnerarie Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be uſed to all wounds, for where I have no need of them, there I omit them; and where they are needful, there I make uſe of them. And I uſed them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, not becauſe I was accuſtomed to it: if I ſhould have done onely according to my cuſtome, I ſhould never have been without ſorrowes.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Cannot choſe but to ſpeak ſomething about ſyringing, and that briefly without any Receipt: ſpouting is much <note place="margin">Spouting or Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> uſed with Lavaments, I deſcribe none of them, becauſe I ſee there is more hurt than good done with them, and ſo I hold their uſe to be unadviſable, and this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood about freſh wounds. And if any wound preciſely be for the uſe of them, he ought not to ſiringe ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any wound or ſtab, be it as deep as it will, elſe the wound within will be driven aſunder, or enlarged and made wider: ſpout ſo gently, that the medicine may only drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly fall out of the Syringe into the wound.</p>
                  <p>But in ſpoiled wounds, which are fiſtulated, to theſe ſiringing may very well be uſed, unto which in ſome place I gave my adviſe. Theſe Syringes muſt be either crooked or ſtraight, as the condition of the wound is, whereby you may come to the bottom of wounds, and to bring the medicines thither alſo. To ſore throats, for pains in the mouth, a ſtrong ſiringing is neceſſary, becauſe through that ſtrong ſpouting, is better waſhed off the ſlyme and filth from teeth, and from the holes of the throat, than when meerly gargariſmes are uſed.</p>

                     <head>Of Wicks or Tents.</head>
                     <p>When Wicks are to be uſed, ye heard it above, <hi>viz.</hi> to wounds where ſpinters are, to flap wounds, to vehement <note place="margin">Swelling tents are naught.</note> bleeding wounds; for other places I do not adviſe them, it being a dangerous abuſe: I hold leſs of ſwelling Tents, unleſs they be made of Juniper Gum, of the root of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana, dry Sponges &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſee what good they can do either in freſh or in dryed wounds: true, they keep a wound aſunder, but cloſe
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:106818:172"/> again quickly, leaving the wound in her old condition: if a ſwelling Tent be put into a Wound, ſtops the hole, lets no matter come forth, keeps it in forcibly, till it be pulled out again, and vent be given to the wound.</p>
                     <p>If Tents needs muſt be uſed to keep open wounds: then <note place="margin">How to make tents to keep wounds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</note> make them of linnen cloth, cover them with an Unguent, mingled with burnt Allum, &amp;c. then they will bite round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and make an open place. My adviſe is that medicins ſhould be conveyed to the bottom of the wound, and not onely to dawb the Tents therewith: and Tents uſed to ſpoiled wounds are ſuch, which of themſelves melt within the wound. Theſe are thruſt home to the bottom of it, <note place="margin">Melting tents.</note> and to the upper place of the wound there is laid another made of linnen, to keep in the firſt Tent, that it come not forth before it is melted; of ſuch Tents I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afore, hoping to ſpeak more largely of it in another place, when I ſhall publiſh my Cures about wound Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's, and the like Sores.</p>

Nature deſires quietneſs, will not be diſquieted by ſuch evil medicines: ſweet and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106818:172"/> gentle things are to be uſed here, and not to preſs Nature with ſharp Corroſives. I never uſed any ſtronger Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to wounds but quenched Allum: true, I hold, that <note place="margin">Extinguiſht Allum.</note> Arſenick is to be uſed to ſpoiled wounds, but my way of preparing of it is, that it deſerves no more the name of a Corroſive or venome; it ſeparates the ill from good, not <note place="margin">Arſenicks operation.</note> cauſing any pain. The Brown Unguent performs all, what is to be done about wounds; as you heard above: in want <note place="margin">Brown Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</note> of this Unguent, you may uſe <hi>

            <head>The Childrens Book OF <hi>FELIX W<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RTZ,</hi> A famous and expert Surgeon.</head>
            <p>This Book was never publiſhed till now.</p>
            <p>Treating of infirmities and defects of new born Children; and of the faults and abuſes, which wet or dry Nurſes commit among and againſt little Children; and of Medicins and Cures, of ſuch Children which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved hurt in that way.</p>
            <p>Written for young Surgeons, wet and dry Nurſes, Maid Servants, and other parties, to whoſe truſt and overlooking little Children are committed.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y purpoſe is to communicate an uſual little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the infirmities of new born Babes and ſucking Children, which are befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len them by the neglect of wet and dry Nurſes, or elſe brought them into the world from their mothers wombe. In the firſt place I will ſpeak ſomething how Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:106818:174"/> wet and dry Nurſes ought to be conditioned, that they may the better deal with ſuch little Children or Babes, even as it becomes an underſtanding, ſober, godly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Such Women to whoſe truſt little Babes are committed, <note place="margin">Duties of ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> ought to be pious, honeſt, modeſt, and civil in words, works, and manners: ſhe muſt be one, that hath been a Mother of Children, and is expert in thoſe waies; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is the Miſtriſs of things, and there is more credit to be given to experienced Women, than to ſuch which know things by hearſay. Therefore if a Midwife be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of credit and fidelitie, and hath endured in her own body, anguiſh, miſeries, and pains, which others neither can nor will beleeve, becauſe they never endured any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their own bodyes; neither may they hear nor have heard of the like: thoſe that had ſuch things befallen them, know what they are; neither is there any need to tell unto ſuch, what miſeries pains and torments mean: and thoſe that were never in ſuch perrilous caſes, may hold their tongues and not ſpeak of it jeeringly or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly.</p>
            <p>It falls out often, that in ſuch dangerous travails, one three, or two looſe their lives, beſides the loſs a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath in his Wife, and poor Children in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. And in caſe ſuch parties may eſcape with their lives in hard travails, yet are they ſo pulled and torn, that they are made unfit for any work, which otherwiſe might have better been preſerved, if honeſtly and faithfully they had been dealt withal. This I ſpeak not as an invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others; let every one look to it, what they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted withal, and make a conſcience in their waies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alſo that they muſt be accountable unto God for it, then they need not to be put in mind of it by my words.</p>
            <p>I beſeech every pious Matron, not to take ill the things I ſpeak of, for what I intend here is for the good of little Children, which cannot complain of their griefs but by crying.</p>
            <pb n="341" facs="tcp:106818:174"/>
            <p> For it is moſt certain, that Children will not cry, unleſs <note place="margin">How Babes reveal their griefs.</note> they ail ſomewhat; becauſe it is more eaſe for them when quiet: and they are not able to make their complaints any other way but by crying. Hence we are to note, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as man is born into the world, then is he made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to endure pains. Therefore good notice muſt be taken what theſe crying Children aileth, wherein they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or pained, that with one thing or other they may be holp. I do not write here of ſuch, that are yet under birth, but of thoſe that are brought already into the world. For I preſume not to write of ſuch things, which I never <note place="margin">What weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he he treateth of.</note> had any experience of; thoſe I leave unto wiſer men. Things that are not commonly known, I intend to deſcribe for the good of bearing Women: for I have been much ſent for to come to Children, and experimentally, knew this or that defect in them; and parents themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that it ſtood with their Children as I told them: and gave warning afterward to young and old, to look to it if the like caſes befall their Children. By ſome my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſell was ſlighted, not hearkening after, much leſs to follow my advice; however ſome honeſt Women thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted of my counſell.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen ſeveral pains and defects in Children, which <note place="margin">He hathſeen the defects of many Children, calls to God to affiſt, him in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</note> could not make their griefs known but with crying, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call to God Almighty for his Grace, that he would be pleaſed to aſſiſt me in this my preſent writing, that it may tend to the Praiſe, Honour, and Glory of his Name; to the welfare of young Children, and to the good of thoſe which love Children: Amen.</p>
            <p>I do not write here for thoſe, which know things as well or better than I; neither do I carp at any: but in caſe there be any which do not underſtand theſe waies, neither had any Children, neither conſidered what ſuch pains and defects incident to Children, might prove; to ſuch I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this my Treatiſe, for an inſtruction unto them. <note place="margin">How a Nurſe to a green Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be fitted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To return again to Nurſes, they muſt be of an honeſt godly life, neither muſt they drudge in heavy toyling works, neither in the field or garden, neither within doors with
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:106818:175"/> waſhing, ſcouring; nor about the fire, or handle any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rough works, whereby their hands are made hard and rough. In caſe that ſuch Midwives or Nurſes are driven to do ſuch ruſtick works, it behoveth a Magiſtrate or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to allow a certain annuity to them, that they be not forced to fall to ſuch rough and hard works. To clear this with a compariſon: if hands are kept clean, becauſe their work in hand is about Silk, fine Linnen, Laces of Gold <note place="margin">Children muſt be handled tenderly.</note> or Silver, is Man not more precious and worthier to be kept clean than all theſe? eſpecially when that young tender Children are not able to ſpeak or complain againſt thoſe, which deal roughly with them, more than their nature and body is able to brook withall, by hard preſſing, thruſting, pinching, burning, &amp;c. and thus ſuch unhappy girds, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are put unto.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen both Mothers and Nurſes, to bind and tye their Children ſo hard, which for pitty ſake made me weep. A Woman that uſually handleth neat work, whoſe hands <note place="margin">Soft fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> are pure, what advantage hath ſhe before ſuch a one, which is forced to do all manner of skullion work? to feel with her fingers ends, &amp;c. As a Barber knoweth the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of ſoft fingers at the touching of veins, before him, whoſe fingers ends are rough and hard: and thoſe alſo know it, which work in Silk.</p>
            <p>A Vein-broken Child is like to fleſh wrapped in a naked skin, as every one may obſerve alſo, who had a ſwelling or wound on his body which is but newly healed, how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſoft that new skin feeleth: even ſo is it with a new born Child. If a man doth but ſcratch his finger, or is pinched, if a heat comes to it, how ſoon he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it; or if he be hurt any other way by a fall, thruſt, &amp;c. whereby ſome danger he falls into, and that place is more painfull unto him than others, which are not hurt. Theſe things any one may be ſenſible of; much more will <note place="margin">A tender Child muſt not behand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rudely.</note> be new born Babes, if roughly or rudely handled, or are hurt in the leaſt manner either with hard hands, rough woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len clothes: or courſe unblanched linnen, or hot and hard ſwaddlings, or when laid upon hard and pricking ſtraw,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:106818:175"/> feathers, or dryed oak leaves; laying the Child in a Cradle purpoſely made, whereby the Childs head may be framed round, lying it on the back alſo, that thus out-ſtretched it may look upward, which furthereth Childrens fancie unto melancholly, itch, frights, and the like: for Children are ſooner full of frights, if placed with their heads upright, than if laid a little ſide way, and that their pillowes may not yeild ſo ſoon or ſo much to their head, as to fall deep in, neither muſt the Nurſes make it ſo purpoſely, as to lay the Child hollow on the pillow, that the Children may the eaſier turn or ſlide: this kind of lying hurteth the Childs memory very much, or it cauſeth other ſimptoms, which afterward are not reduced ſo eaſily, and the Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid on their backs, it cauſeth heavy and melancholly dreames, which old people do find, if they lie on their <note place="margin">Lying on the back is hurtfull.</note> backs, and the heavy melancholly blood runs about their heart, putting them into anguiſhes and frights: ſome do think that then they are awakened, are troubled with ſtrange thoughts, break forth into ſtrange words, from their fancies they had in their ſleep; he thinketh he awakneth, &amp; yet cannot awaken, becauſe his talking and out-calling keeps him thus.</p>
            <p>Some uſe to lie their Children in the Cradles higher at <note place="margin">Children muſt be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher at their feet than their head when?</note> their feet, than at their head or heart, at which I marvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many times. But if a Child hath ſcabbed ſwelled leggs or feet, then their feet muſt be laid ſomewhat higher, that the blood run not too much into the feet, and the pulling itching pains be not increaſed thereby: let every one be judge here, that is troubled with naughty leggs, if he hath but a little bliſter about his foot or ancle, what pains he feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then, if his legg hangeth down: what do you think a Child endureth in this caſe.</p>
            <p>If the Child be ſound in body, leggs and feet, then it <note place="margin">To lay a ſound child that it may ſleep well.</note> may lie higher at his feet than at his ſides, but not higher than it lyeth at his heart and head: this I hold to be very good. Therefore my advice is, to make that part of the bed ſomewhat higher where the Childs ſide is to lye, then his head and heart will lye higher than his feet and body, which is the ſafeſt and eaſieſt way for his reſt.</p>
            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:106818:176"/>
            <p> Touching the rocking of Children; ſome Mothers uſe their Children to it at the firſt, but others do it when they <note place="margin">What the rocking of the Cradle is?</note> would have them ſleep, and others rock them when they cry; others there are which will not uſe their Children to it at all, as one a Clergy Mans Wife did, who ſet her Child every night into a Cellar, becauſe nothing ſhould diſquiet him in his ſleep, not thinking on any other things the Child might befall, but no honeſt Woman I hope will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that faſhion. In my judgement I hold it to be beſt, that if a Child be laid down in Gods Name, &amp;c. to rock it gently, and not too hard, then let it reſt. But if a Child ſleepeth unquietty being as it were frighted, as it can be perceaved, when it ſnorteth, ſnuffeth, or when frightned, or cryeth, then rock it gently again, then the melancholly blood which oppreſt the Child, and frightned it, is by rocking brought to right again out of its fear and anguiſh, and are diſperſed or expelled.</p>
            <p>It falls out ſometimes, that a Mother meaneth to quiet her Child with rocking, whereby the Child is the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieter, and with crying inflames his head ſo vehemently, that in many daies he cannot be brought to right again: ſometimes ſuch a Child aileth that which a Mother doth not think of, ſuppoſing to be the Childs frowardneſs, which is not ſo, but it feeleth ſomething to be amiſs in the bed, which doth hurt it, or its hand lyeth hard, or a prick, ſtraw, or hard feather doth prick it, or a pin, which eareleſs Nurſes left in the linnen, or a flea or louſe tormenteth the Child: therefore my advice is, that if a Child will not be quieted, to take it up and ſee what doth ail it,</p>
            <p>Little Children are tormented alſo ſometimes with the Cramp, when they are taken up, then their blood runs <note place="margin">To help Children of the Cramp.</note> up and down, and by that means are they quieted; few people take notice of the cauſe of it: and is remedied when the bloud getteth its courſe again, and come to that place which was bereaved of it, it warmeth that part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which warmth driveth the Cramp away, and the pains which are cauſed thereby. A Cramp will hold a Child ſtrongly if once it takes poſſeſſion in a Child, cauſeth
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106818:176"/> great pains below and above; as theſe pains are to the Children continue in their crying, and commonly the Gout doth accompany it. Therefore theſe things muſt be taken good notice of, when the Child cryeth much either half ſleeping or awakened, then take it up, and wrap it in warm clothes. This miſery is cauſed by the following things, <hi>viz.</hi> when Children are kept cold in the Nurſes or Mothers lap, or in the bed, bath, or lye in wet clouts, bepiſſed by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſuch Children ſit naked on the flower, or ſtone, I have ſeen that the ſitting ſo naked on cold places hath proved ſo dangerous unto Children, that in ſhort time they were creepled, with whom I had great toyle, before I could recover them to their former health; for if once they take cold in that way, they are hardly recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>This befalls old people alſo, ſome whereof I have ſeen dye of, in great anguiſh and miſery, and lay long by it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dyed. Therefore tender Children muſt by all means be kept warm, not to ſhake ſtir and dally them too much. If a new skin in old people be tender, what is it you think in a new born Babe? Doth a ſmall thing pain you ſo much on a finger, how painfull is it then to a Child, which is tormented all the body over, which hath but a tender new grown fleſh? if ſuch a perfect Child is tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo ſoon, what ſhall we think of a Child, which ſtayed not in the wombe its full time? ſurely it is twice worſe with him.</p>
            <p>Touching Baths of Children, it is known that they are <note place="margin">Childs Bath.</note> bathed ſometimes ſo hot, that the heat thereof is ſcarcely ſufferable to an old bodies hand, whoſe skin is ſtrong: we muſt not here, that if a water bath be made for any one, which ſeemeth to him to be not very hot, at that time when he was ſcabby, and went in the firſt time; ſo the skin of a Child is ſo thin and tender, as his, who is full of ſcabbs. A hand which is uſually naked, can endure more cold, heat, air, &amp;c. than that ſtrong ſound body, which uſually is not naked, &amp;c. This every one doth or may conceive eaſily if he taketh notice of: ſome Women are ſo careleſs, that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106818:177"/> they take no notice, nor obſerve, what pains they do or may cauſe unto others, and make Baths for Children ſo hot, as if Children were able to brook with, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Children are weak in their little bodies, and not ſo ſtrong, as aged people are in theirs.</p>
            <p>The bodies of ſuch little Children may be compared to a young and tender root or twigg of a Tree, which in the fouch is not ſo groſſe as an old root or branch of a Tree; take heed you cauſe no paines unto little Children, that they may not be filled with pains in their joints, whereby they are made unfit ever to follow cloſely or well any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick calling. And it is a moſt certain thing, that thoſe which are bathed too hot, get a more tany skin, than thoſe which are not bathed ſo hot: neither muſt they be bathed too cold, elſe there will be cauſed to them pains in the <note place="margin">Pains in the belly, and the Cramp how cauſed.</note> belly, and the cramp, and is then moſt of all cauſed, when Children are naked in the water, are not covered in their body, or elſe when the bath is made too thin, or when ſuch a bath is made but once, and no more uſed a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and no order is obſerved herein, or when the Child is taken out of the bath, and they care not how long they keep it in the lap. Some uſe to lye the Children bathed behind the hot oven, whereby the Child may ſoon be <note place="margin">Children are hurt if after bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are laid behind a hot Oven.</note> ſtiffled or choaked, not regarding, whether that heat doth not cauſe a pain in the body or head, ſuppoſing onely if the Child be but laid behind the oven, then is it well cared for. Some have that cuſtome, when they have bathed their children, then they rub them with Wine, and the whites of Eggs, ſaying now I think I waſhed my Child neatly; and rub it ſo ſtrongly as if they had an old bodyes skin in hand, which is grown hard, thereby to ſoften it; they do not conſider, that if an old bodyes skin after bath ſhould be ſo rubbed, and the party were ſcabbed, how he would be affected with it: or if a ſound bodyes skin ſhould be thus ſtretched or reacht, what pain would it cauſe to it, little do they conſider, what great wrongs are done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by unto little Children.</p>
            <pb n="347" facs="tcp:106818:177"/>
            <p> All honeſt Mothers and Nurſes will be cautious and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Children muſt not be kept loug naked or wet.</note> that their Children be not uncovered too long, be it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at their taking up or their carrying about, and ought to be laid dry down again; in like manner when they are taken out of the bath, they muſt be received in a warm cloth, the Dray alſo in which the Child was bathed, muſt be ſo placed, that no ayr may come to the Child in the bath, and that it take no cold by opening of Caſements, Doors, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Child muſt be well guarded above, to be wet the leſs, and its head dreſſings and attires be not made wet, elſe great hurt and wrong is done unto the Child: for a Childs head or body being waſhed, and then to let it ſit thus wet, and let it take cold, it wrongeth the Child ſo much, that it will ſtick unto him even to his old age, rheums will trouble them, about the eyes, their hearing decayeth, their heads break out, eſpecially if you let Children take cold in their wet heads, then ſuch wrongs are done unto them, which hardly can be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>In caſe a Childs head muſt be waſhed and cleanſed, then <note place="margin">A wet head taking cold wrongeth young and old people.</note> it muſt be dryed again ſuddainly, let it not be moiſt too long, for if you do, it will be troubled with running eyes, hard hearing, rheums in the face, noſe, gumms, ſhoulders, arms, and their body will be troubled with cold diſeaſes, which he will not be rid of all his lifetime. Therefore I warn you faithfully, that you keep not long Childrens heads wet, nor let them come into the cold with wet heads, which is more dangerous than if in a warm place.</p>
            <p>Now will I ſpeak of the thruſh in Children, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens thruſh in the mouth.</note> many Children ſtarv'd, and I cured of that weakneſs, more than a hundred of them.</p>
            <p>For a warning, I will give a hint of faults committed by Nurſes, in their rude manner of waſhing Childrens mouthes, whereby they do and have cauſed this great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief unto Children.</p>
            <p>Some indiſcreet people take wool, or rough linnen, or the bath cloth out of the bath, feel with it to the throat, <note place="margin">Cauſe of the thruſh.</note> and ſo waſh it, ſaying how furr'd is this Child in the throat,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106818:178"/> I muſt waſh off that white ſtuff, and rub it ſo hard that they pull off their ſubtile skin, even as a ſoft rind is peeled off the tree, which if once done, then the next day his mouth groweth more white, which if they ſee it, then they feel further into the mouth, and fall on waſhing of his mouth, ſaying, this Childs tongue looks white, I muſt ſcrape his tongue, and ſcrape and waſh away the tender skin of his tongue, and make it bleed, which ſurely cauſeth the thruſh in the mouth, and the more they go on in their waſhing, the worſe they make it. This great fault about the mouth waſhing, hath moved me to write this Treatiſe, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat all good people not to make uſe of ſuch waſhing, and to warn others from it alſo: for the tongue doth cleanſe it ſelf, being a member which is ſtill in motion, and groweth not weary.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, why ſhould not Children be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <label type="milestone">

               </label> people, which neither know, nor can diſtinguiſh, what this ſlyme, ſlabber, or skin is: what wonder? if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern it in aged people, how ſhould they be able to diſcern it in Children, in whom it may ſooner be diſcerned than in aged people, and is a great deal more dangerous in aged people, than in little Babes.</p>
            <p>It is known among judicious people, that every new born <note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens mouth.</note> Child, if ſound, is pale and white in the throat, and if it be red or green in the throat, then is it hurt or wounded, and his cheeks and tongue are yet white, eſpecially on the middlemoſt ſtreak, what need then to have it ſcraped, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or rubbed, to make it red?</p>
            <p>Sometimes there riſe bliſters on the tongue, and alſo on <note place="margin">Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the cheeks within, and at the throat; of theſe I do not ſpeak now, but if a Mother or a Nurſe knoweth whether they are bliſters or no, as many of ſuch were brought to me, which were tampered too long withal, inſomuch that their mouthes ſtunk, and could neither eat nor drink: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore care muſt be had to be ſure whether it be the begining
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106818:178"/> of a thruſh, or whether it be a defect the Child brought into the world; for if their mouthes ſtink ſtrongly, then is it not natural, but comes from putrifaction and filth: for ſuch I do not ſay, that no remedies ſhould be uſed; but I ſpeak of thoſe, which ſcrape and rub Childrens mouthes ſo long, till they have pulled off that little skin, whereby is cauſed the thruſh.</p>
            <p>It uſually comes to paſs, when Children are fed with <note place="margin">How much children are wronged by hot papps.</note> hot paps, which burns their mouth, tongue, &amp;c. which careleſsly Nurſes, Maids, or rude labouring Mothers do commit, which have hard skins on their fingers, before they can feel how hot the pap is, they burn the Children, whereby ſmall bliſters on their tongues &amp; lips are cauſed like to burnt bliſters, which are difficult to be healed, which if not well looked to, will prove the thruſh; therefore care muſt be had, that Childrens food be not given too hot.</p>
            <p>In ſome places Children are fed in this manner: they <note place="margin">Some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes to feed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> take a ſpoonful of pap out of the pan, put it into the mouth, then put it again into the ſpoon, then they give it to the Child: in this manner Children are not ſo ſoon burnt, but they fumble ſo much with the ſpoon about the Childs lips, which if no heed taken will cauſe bliſters alſo, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Children in their feeding, and the thruſh is partly cauſed thereby.</p>
            <p>Therefore let Nurſes look to it that they wound not the Child with the ſpoon; for though aged people may feed themſelves ſafely with ſpoons, as being uſed to it, yet a Child may be hurt with it, being unuſed to it: and if aged people may be hurt with a ſpoon at the eating, much more a tender young Child: and if a ſpoon doth not ſcratch or cut on the one ſide, it may do it on the other, which if not regarded, may ſoon bring ſome hurt.</p>
            <p>Moreover they uſe to warm the Childrens pap again in Butter or Oyl, and when that fatneſs ſwimmeth above, and they taking off ſome of it with the ſpoon, then they blow away the fatneſs ſtrongly, not having a care, whether any of it leapeth into the Childrens eye or face: I have ſeen it, that Childrens faces grew full of ſcurfe, even upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:106818:179"/> that cauſe, and looked as if they had been leprous: <hi>Item</hi>

            <p>If a child hath an itch in his feet or hands, then it muſt <note place="margin">If they feel an itch in their hands or feet, what to do?</note> not be kept too warm, but muſt ſometimes lye uncovered, elſe it can have no reſt or ſleep. There grows alſo little worms in childrens hands or feet, which if killed, give a ſnap like a nit, theſe ſuffer not little children to ſleep: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe worms have I digged out, which if not digged out, no hope for any reſt, which being once taken out, then theſe children are at eaſe in their hands and feet; and if children are bathed, theſe worms are drowned: Allum and Salt maketh them ingender, but if Sulphur uſed it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them quickly. Nurſes muſt look to it, whether chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be troubled with ſuch worms, or whether onely with a ſcurfe, if an itching one, then ſuch children muſt be laid into the Cradle ſo, that they may turn themſelves, they will the ſooner ſettle to reſt, for after their own rubbing, the ſmart being gone, will the ſooner bring them to ſleep. For this grief in children about theſe itching worms, no better thing can be uſed, then a water Bath in which Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is boiled in; it doth not heal it ſo ſoon, as when ſuch children are annointed with, in a dry way. In caſe the child cannot be put into a wet Bath, then apply the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is ſpoken of afterward; in a broad and long way, as far as theſe running worms have made their tracks, which Ointment muſt be let alone there for two daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be taken off: it taketh away the pains, and the worms are killed under it. I made experiments upon mine own children, and found it very good.</p>
            <p>Children are troubled ſometimes alſo with burning bliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">Sharp burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bliſters in children and their cure.</note> which are full of heat &amp; pain, theſe muſt not be let alone till they are dryed up, by reaſon of their tormenting pains: the following plaiſter applyed to it is very good. ℞ of Wax and Roſin of each a like quantitie, put ſome Oyl to it, let theſe melt together, ſpread ſome of it on a cloth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it and let it ſtay there for a day, though ſome matter
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:106818:179"/> gets out of it, it is no hurt: or, ℞ a Honey Plaiſter, or Suet, &amp;c. It is better to uſe any of theſe, than to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone naked.</p>
            <p>Children are troubled alſo with Fellow feeders, <note place="margin">Fellow ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> which are continually growing at the back betwixt the two ſhoulders. To cure them of theſe I took the children into a hot Stove, let them be well heated, afterward I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed their back with Honey, then theſe black worms crept forth, which ſhaved off with a Raſor, having itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it twice or thrice, then all theſe itchings ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Children are troubled alſo with pains betwixt their <note place="margin">Smarting in children.</note> thighes, under their arms, and near their privities, at the making of water they feel ſmarting pains. Some do help this with ravelings of linnen, which they apply to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places, which doth no hurt according as they do it. For ſome ſcrape it off with a knife, (lint) which is nought; ravelings of cloth are better, the former ſtick too cloſe. Others waſh their children in theſe ſmarting places with Wine. Others take freſh Water, and waſh their children therewith in ſuch places, which in my opinion is better, <note place="margin">The true cure for ſmarting pains.</note> cauſing leſs ſmarts than the Wine doth; being after waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well dryed, then annoint the affected places with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Suet, and with warm Ointments theſe places be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, where there urine may come unto. Pomatum is good alſo for the bitings cauſed by urin.</p>
            <p>And to make theſe outward means to be more effectual, it is neceſſary, that rules preſcribed be obſerved alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mother or Nurſe muſt abſtain from ſalt ſharp meats, as red Hearing, pickled Cabbage, <hi>Bartholomies</hi> Beef; no Meats of Spieces, as dreſſed with Pepper, Ginger, and ſuch like hot Spices; for as the Mothers dyet is, ſo the childrens urin will be, of a ſharp biting qualitie more or leſs. Bayes are the beſt help for ſuch pains.</p>
            <p>Some Childrens eyes are alwaies running, others have <note place="margin">Running eyes in children,</note> ſore eyes, and ſome of them have their eyes clung together, The which to remedy, Mothers or Nurſes uſually let their Milk run into them, of which I do approve; provided that ſuch Nurſes feed not upon any Garlick, Pepper, Muſtard, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="352" facs="tcp:106818:180"/>
            <p> The clear Water which runneth out of childrens eyes, is leſs curable or ſtayed, than if their eyes be ſore: for a little ſoreneſs of eyes is not dangerous, but rather a wholeſome cleanſing of the whole head and brains: but the clear water often cauſeth cronical Simptoms. In caſe the child is not able to brook any light, or to open his eyes, trouble it not with opening of them, unleſs the water in his eyes ceaſe and dry up; then let his eyes he opened twice a day, open his eye lids but not againſt the fire, but onely in a dark place; although the child lyeth in a dark place, yet his face muſt at that time, be ſtill more turned to darkneſs. Let no white <note place="margin">All ſhining things ought to be removed from bad eyes.</note> clothes hang over or about the child, it would be hurtful to his eyes, ſight; eſpecially fire and candle light is hurtful to his eyes, if children be laid to look toward or into it: and all other burning things of a flame, are hurtful to ſuch eyes, and cauſe ſmarting pains.</p>
            <p>Let every one be warned, to keep off every brightneſs or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Felix Wurtz</hi> teſtifieth what hurt bright things did to his bad eyes.</note> heat from ſharp humors in the eyes, and not to ſuffer that Sun, Moon, Day, Fire, Light, or any other whiteneſs of a Wall, Sealings, &amp;c. give any ſhine to ſuch eyes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to keep off the Sun Shine. I found it by experience how hurtful hot glimbles of ſhines are to eyes: for one time being troubled with an head ach, opening my eyes toward the place where the windowes ſtood open, looking then on a new whitned Wall, thinking the windowes were ſhut, (but ſtood open unknown to me) there ſtrook a white glaſs or ſhine ſo ſtrongly into my brains, that I thought I nere felt ſo great a pain in my life. Let every honeſt body be perſwaded, to beleeve that the like will be cauſed in young children, and not ſuffer any white or hot ſhinings fall on their bad eyes. I have been troubled with many infirmities in my body, but never felt greater pain than that head ach, cauſed by looking on that new white Wall, hath brought upon me: and was enforced by theſe extraordinary pains to have the pulſe or temple vein on the left ſide to be cut, which all Surgeons, Barbars, and good friends diſwaded me from; my Wife alſo by perſwaſion ſuffered no knife or other cutting inſtrument be brought
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:106818:180"/> near me, and kept all ſuch things from me, and all ſuch that came to ſee me, were intreated to let me not have any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inſtrument to cut or ſtab withal. All were affraid I would lay violent hands on my ſelf, by reaſon of the great pains I was in. Thus making pittiful mourn to Surgeons and all my friends, on whom I called for help, intreating them to cut the pulſe vein on my left temple, which crying and calling, I continued for ten dayes, thoſe that heard my outcries, ſupoſed I did out of impatience, for the which none would hearken unto my cries; but I continued ſtill with my lamentation, hoping one or other would take pitty on me: At laſt my friends conſidered of my cries, and promiſed in caſe any one would undertake the cutting of the pulſe vein, they would then conſent unto my demand; I thanked God that my cries were heard, and my pulſe vein to be cut: then came that famous and conſcionable Dr. <hi>Cennad Geſner,</hi> comforted me and my familie, and adviſed <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> adviſeth for an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that my pulſe vein ſhould be opened, then returned I thanks to God again, who put this councill into his heart: then was I asked, what means ſhould be uſed for the ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of that blood, and inciſion; I gave directions to the Surgeons then preſent, that my friend and Brother in Law, <hi>John Waſer</hi> ſhould make the inciſion, he took it in <note place="margin">

               <p>It is the faſhion in ſome Countries, that when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to lie their Children to ſleep, they lay them on a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on a great pillow, and have their woven or hemmed linnen ſwadling clothes, whereby they bind the Child in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the clouts, from the arms downwards, but others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from below, and bind along upward, and on the Cradle they are lain, whereby the inlaid Child is packed up like a pack of Wares; this I do not much miſlike, provided the Child be not tyed or pack'd too hard.</p>
               <p>In other places, Nurſes or Mothers take Children into their lap, wrap the Child into a woolen cloth, after they have wrapped them firſt into ſmall linnen clouts, binding arms and hands down, and begin in their tying from above downward; but this I approve not ſo well of, as of the former way, becauſe theſe clouts fall thicker, cauſe unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs to Children, of the which more ſhall be ſaid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; how Children are hurt thereby: having bound and wrapped the Child thus, then they lay it in the Cradle, and tye it once more.</p>

               <head>Of crooked and lame Children, coming thus into the World.</head>
               <p>It hapneth that a Child is born with crooked feet, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and preſſed one upon another, and muſt go on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles if they can; they uſually ſay, that ſuch lame births are cauſed by frights, ſtrange ſights, or by careleſneſs, which alſo Nurſes have to anſwer for. Theſe defects they ſay uſually are incurable; it agreeth with that ſaying, no body maketh himſelf crooked. Theſe idle pratings cauſeth careleſs and lazy people, pretending, if my lame Child cannot be cured, why ſhould I be at expences or taking of pains. It is a baſe and falſe excuſe, becauſe experience proveth it to be otherwiſe. To liken this to an example, many have eaten from that Trees fruit, which they nurſed by putting the kernell into the ground; my ſelf have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the fruit of a Tree, ſix yeers after I put the kernel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into the ground. Even ſo is it with lame Children, ſome whereof I cured ſo, that after ſome yeers I ſaw them go ſtraight. Let no man be neglective if his Child be thus crooked, as not to ask counſel about it; though all be not recovered which are in ſuch caſes, yet many are cured, and if not perfectly, yet may they be mended in ſome ſort; the which I do demonſtrate with examples. I have dreſſed a new born Child, and ordered it with ſplinters as I thought fitting, whoſe feet from his Mothers wombe ſtood ſo, that the Child ſtood on the outſide ancle, which with ſplinters I brought to right, and that Child went as ſtraight as any other.</p>
               <p>I have cured Children, whoſe thumbs and other fingers, <note place="margin">No crooked joint ought to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but plainly to be ſet right.</note> have lain in their hands for many years, tyed them outward, but did not break the joints, as they uſually ſay, that they muſt be broken again, wich is falſe, and he that ſaith ſo diſcovereth his ſillineſs in Surgerie; they ought not to be broken, but gently and ſteedily be placed right: for if a Child be put to pains in that kind, the joint will be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereby, and the caſe made worſe and more painfull, than it was formerly. My advice is, that none ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:106818:182"/> to break, nor permit any to do or undertake the doing of it raſhly; and if you meet with one that give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the thing might be done without pains, and that in ſuch a way the cure might be performed, then follow his advice: but he that ſaith that firſt of all ſuch joints muſt be fomented, bathed, annointed, he goeth the contrary way to work, for thereby the joint is not made ſoft but ſtiffer. But if Childrens ancles, kees, feet, fingers, &amp;c. are ſo hard and ugly, that they muſt be firſt of all mollifyed, then ſuch medicines may do ſomething. And ſo I ſpeak here not of all, but of ſuch which are curable,</p>
               <p>Therefore obſerve, whether that joint doth bow and turn eaſily to the place where it ſhould be, then bind it that way, and cure it. Some of ſuch joints will eaſily turn and bow, but that is not enough; binding is for ſuch a joint the better, the growing whereof bringeth forward the cure, and not the bowing or ſetting; the bowing of it is good, but it is not all, but it muſt be ſet and laid right alſo, then the one helps the other, and the growth in time is brought on: though little amendment is ſeen in a week, moneth, or three moneths, yet a whole years time may produce ſomething, and in time perfectneſs comes in. But how to <note place="margin">How to ſet and dreſſe crooked joints.</note> ſet and bind crooked joints, is not poſſible to ſet down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular thereof, the Surgeon muſt take notice and obſerve, which way his ſplinters and other things will ſit beſt.</p>
               <p>No ſplinter muſt be too cloſe applyed here, neither muſt they be bound too hard; if too hard, and the Child cryeth out by reaſon of the pains it feels, then inſtantly tie it ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, for ſuch pains would cauſe great miſchief: therefore bind ſuch joints ſoftly and gently, according to the place. <note place="margin">Some joints are bound hard, ſome ſlack.</note> For a foot is and muſt be tyed more ſtrongly than a hand, and a hand can endure a band more ſtrongly tyed than a finger: conceave thus of the reſt of the joints. The ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the joint is, the better is it able to endure a ſtronger band: and again the leſs a joint is, the worſe it can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a band.</p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:106818:182"/>
               <p> You are to obſerve exactly, when there cometh into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny joint, pains, redneſs, ſmartings, blewiſhneſs or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſitie, a ſwelling or the like ſimptome, then is it very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous; for then you have bound it too hard, unbind it preſently, the Childs welfare lyeth herein, if not his life: for theſe joints cannot endure any pain; this you ought to take good notice of.</p>
               <p>This is my faithful advice, that you do not deal too hard with it, at the firſt you ought to bind it gently, then you may ſoon perceave, whether you are or may proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more hard in it. For in ſuch caſes Surgeons muſt not preſently go on, as they ought to do in fracture bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; in caſe it doth fit here the firſt time, then you are to let it reſt, and not to trouble your ſelf nor the Child any further, if it fitteth well at the firſt time, then go on, in few weeks you will perceave the amendment thereof, you may alter the band as the defect requireth.</p>
               <p>When you are to dreſſe a Childs crooked joint, then take my red Plaiſter, which groweth ſtiff and hard, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cloſely, and as you meaſured your ſplinters, then take the Plaiſter ſpread on a cloth, apply it on the ſplinters, that it may ſtick thereunto, and cover the ſplinter well in the inſide, then that band holdeth faſt; for it keepeth the ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo faſt together, as a Saddle holds firmly which is glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. The overplus of the Plaiſter, which goeth or runneth beyond the ſplinters, you cut off and ſpread the Plaiſter there on the ſplinters, as you uſe to do at a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures dreſſing with ſplintures ſpread with the Plaiſter, then apply a Plaiſter to the ſame joint, yet not ſo cloſe together as to have them laid one on another, as I adviſed you in my ſecond part of Surgerie touching bone fractures: in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures it muſt not be laid ſo cloſe together, as in theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle joints, becauſe theſe joints neither ſwell nor conſume, it pulled not too hard but gently: it is better they be bound ſlack a whole week, than too hard one hour. Then apply your meaſured ſplinters, you need but two, and not three, four, or more, which other fractures require. Then bind this joint as it fitteth in the bowing, and let it reſt thus
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:106818:183"/> bound ten or fourteen daies, as you ſee occaſion: you need not to fear any ſimptom here, if you bound it not too hard, nor too untimely, and do as you did formerly; if the caſe be altered and mended, then your ſplinters and binders muſt be accordingly altered: and there is not any Craft worſe to be deſcribed than even this, as how one ſhould prepare, keep and behave him in his ſplinters and bands, it is a thing almoſt impoſſible: I have often pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it, and had good ſucceſs therein; God be praiſed for ever: Amen.</p>

               <head>Of crooked and diſlocated Leggs, cauſed by careleſs layings, and of their cure.</head>
               <p>I have ſeen Children born ſtraight, yet became lame and crooked, and could not be healed ſtraight again; their Mothers or Nurſes told me of the manner, how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to be thus lame and crooked: I bid them many times to untie the Child, and to tie and bind it again, to ſee the manner of it; where I then quickly perceaved, in what they had miſſed, which was done and committed in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I ſpoke of it above: for they lying the Child in their lap, and toward the feet binding it ſo, that the Childs knees comes together in lying, and puts ſome Boulſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, and will not leave the birth as God hath created it, will have their Children yet handſomer, by binding them ſtraighter to their thinking; tye and bind them more crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:106818:183"/> doing it too hard, which maketh the Child unquiet, turns and winds himſelf ſo long, till he gets ſomewhat looſe, in this way the Child groweth like a twigg, according as it was tyed. But by the help of God the like caſes may be remedied, and my ſelf have done many ſuch cures, when Children were ſpoiled with ſuch untoward bindings, and had carryed it on above ſixteen years long; as long as they are growing, ſo long are they in the ſtate to be mended and ſet ſtraighter: when Children are bound ſtraight with ſtrong binding, then they uſually grow crooked; and none will grow more ſtraight in his body, than thoſe which are laid free and looſe with their hands and feet: therefore my advice is, not to uſe any curioſities at the laying and binding your Children, unleſs there be ſome miſcreance, or other unſhapedneſs about them, then is it reaſon and time to adviſe with good Surgeons, who will tell you how theſe faults are to be ordered and mended, and let not people follow onely their own counſel and fancies.</p>
               <p>Some reply here; I am fain to tie and bind my Child hard, by reaſon of his ſcabbie feet, if I do not ſo, then it rubs them together, and maketh them ſmart, and then it cannot be quieted.</p>
               <p>Others which have no skill how to bind them right, ſay, though I bind my Child hard, yet it ſlideth and ſlippeth out of the band, which cauſeth me to wrap and bind it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: theſe neither mind nor care what or how they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, nor know how they ſhould do it, neither will they adviſe with others about it, but go on obſtinately in their ill accuſtomed waies; binding their Childrens ſhins toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making them lame and creeple. Therefore I adviſe you to take better courſe in theſe bindings, and chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove about the breaſt and heart, not to put Children to miſeries that way.</p>
               <p>Further I counſell Mothers and Nurſes not to bind their <note place="margin">What hurts Children gets, if not covered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſhoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> clouts too ſtrongly together at the end of their feet, which maketh Children lame in their going or ſtanding. If Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens ſhoulders are left open or uncovered, it is great hurt to them, by reaſon of the pores, which are more open than
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:106818:184"/> aged peoples, becauſe their skin is very tender: it is a pain to them all night long, eſpecially in froſty nights, and when they come to age, they are full of rheums, have heavy arms, and grow lame in their hands, ſhoulders, elbowes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the upper parts of the body, about the head, the eyes, the ſinews all the body over, in their hearing, and pains in their back bone. Never more complaints made by men but about ſuch lameneſſes, when they took cold in their young years, lying thus uncovered in their Cradles.</p>
               <p>To prevent theſe ſeveral inconveniences and hurts inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <note place="margin">A fit gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Children to wear in their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</note> to Children, my advice is, that Childrens caps and ſleeves ſhould be all of one piece, or ſowed together: for a cap of it ſelf, and ſleeves apart, though they cover the parts they are made for, yet the Child is not all covered that way: but if cap and ſleeves be ſowed together, as one piece, it is the beſt way: though the Child pulls his hand out of the Cradle, yet are his ſhoulders covered; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the heart and ſtomack of the Child the better, and his clothes muſt be made the wider, that they may fall one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another, and lye double.</p>
               <p>This in my opinion, is a proper garment for a Child to lay in, in the Cradle, then there is no need of the ſtrong band above about the body, and are thus beſt covered and guarded from cold. And that you may not need to tye the Child too ſtrong about the feet, then take great and long clouts, which may go about the feet twice double, and lay other linnen between the ancles to keep them aſſunder: and if you will not bind the Child, yet lye it warm, ſo that the feet may not touch nor rub one againſt another: if ſuch great and long linnen may not be had of every one, then let them uſe other clouts, provided they cut off the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings about them, which tickle the skin, and cauſe a rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.</p>
               <p>Some people hath that ill and baſe cuſtome, they fling <note place="margin">To caſt up Children and catch them is an ill faſhion.</note> with one hand the Child upward, and catch it with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which can cauſe no other, but that ſuch Children u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually take frightnings in their ſleep, becauſe that dancing in the Nurſes hands comes to them in their ſleep by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106818:184"/> thinking they are leaping or jumping in their Nurſes hands. The like befalls aged people, who having been on a dangerous tempeſtious Sea, in their ſleep they are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly frightned, thinking they are in that dangerous Sea ſtill.</p>
               <p>Though Children are not ſo much frightned by that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, yet there are other ſports for them to be dallyed withall, for it falls out ſometimes, that Children in that dancing are let fall, which can it be done without hurt unto the Child? I have ſeen a Father taking his little boy by the ſhoulder, and threw him upward, the ſport pleaſed the boy very well, deſired his Father to do it again and again; this paſtime pleaſed Father and Son for a while, but one time the boy being flung too high, and turning in that flinging came out of his Fathers reach, fell down behind his Father, who was not able to ſtay him then in his fall. This ſport was turned into lamentation.</p>
               <p>Some daunce their Children on their lap, with their legs <note place="margin">A warning againſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too much on the knee or lap.</note> outſtretched, and theſe regard not the tenderneſs of their leggs and ſinewes; in that way of dancing theſe little ones may eaſily receave hurt. After ſuch dancing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>y lay the Child down, when the next day the Child is taken up, then is it ſore, cryeth, cannot endure ſuch dallying, or be toucht or carryed about: then they ſay, I wonder what aileth my Child, I laid it laſt night well and ſound into the Cradle, and was cheerfull, and could dance in my lap, now it cryeth, if I do but touch it: thus they blame the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Child, when themſelves are in fault. Then they bring it to the Surgeon, ſaying, pray ſee what my Child aileth, for it can neither ſtand nor go, and yet nothing is ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, no ſign or ſpot at all about his skin, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what hurt it ſhould have received; I fear it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, &amp;c. If a Surgeon ſaith ſome tuxation hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len this Child, or it is handled roughtly, or hath been over playd: they reply, Oh no! our Child was not hurt of us; and will not confeſſe their apiſh play: if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their fault, then their Child might the ſooner be cured. My advice is this, uſe no apiſh tricks to your Children, let
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106818:185"/> them keep that health, which God hath beſtowed on them, not to pull or to hale them from one place to another, with dancing, jumping, juggling, &amp;c. and playing, like as the Cat doth with a Mouſe: for theſe tricks wrongeth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo much, that when full grown, it is ſeen then what hard ſhifts they are put to, to do their works.</p>
               <p>The like befell my eldeſt Son, it is a pitty, and all thoſe that know him do pitty him; for he is quite diſabled to do any work, and muſt continue ſo as long as he liveth, onely upon ſuch an accident as I told now; which held him to the twelfth year of his age, and it was concealed from me that he had it from ſuch dancing: if they had confeſſed it in time, that with that kind of ſporting it was cauſed, then by Gods aſſiſtance I might have cured him.</p>

               <p>Sometimes I found a fracture on a Childs legg, or arm, or a crack; and when I ſaid the Child received this or that hurt, and talking to them of it which had the overſight, they durſt not confeſs how the Child was hurt, fearing their Maſters and Miſtreſſes diſpleaſure, when the Child was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then the neighbours Children would ſay, how the Child was hurt at ſuch a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me. Sometimes they cannot tell what the Child aileth, though it hath received hurt from another; and thoſe Nurſes or Maids which were to look to the Children, though they outſtand it moſt that the Child was not hurt, where found to be the onely fault of that hurt the Child received; but when they ſaw the Child do well, and was cured, then they bewray it, what hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have kept cloſe. Children when carryed about, may ſoon be hurt in ſuch a manner, that they can never be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped again.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:106818:185"/>
               <p> In ſome places Children are carryed about in mantles, or Table clothes, as at <hi>Bambury</hi> and <hi>Forchheym</hi> I have ſeen it: in this way Children may be hurt leaſt, if carryed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the arm, and ſlencker'd up and down by lazy Maids are eaſily hurt in that manner. I have eſpyed the like <note place="margin">Children are hurt by untoward carrying of them.</note> miſchiefs done to Children by ſuch rude carrying, but durſt not reprove them for it, theſe impudent wenches would have outfaced me therein. Some Childrens back bone have I ſeen cratkt in two, and the verticles thereof were diſjoyned, and removed ſo far, that they could never be brought together again, or if joyned, could not be kept ſo long, if that once hapneth to Children, then they go bowed, and their head almoſt between their thighes, or elſe they halt or limp on both ſides. This comes from a careleſs carrying Children abroad and about.</p>
               <p>Therefore be warned, not to carry Children abroad too <note place="margin">When chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be carryed on arms.</note> ſoon, before his back bone and ſinewes be ſtrong enough; unleſs the party that is to carry it, knoweth well to handle a Child in carrying, and to ſtay the Childs back with her hand; let it be carryed as well as it may, yet it ſoon falls out that a Child gets a diviſion or ſtrain in the back, which may prove a great inconvenience to the Child. Little Maids are ſometimes intruſted to carry a Child, a Child overturning himſelf or lenting backward, that girle is not able to ſtay the Child, by this means little Children may ſoon get hurt.</p>
               <p>Children commonly are carryed on one arm, as thoſe uſually do, which are wont to carry onely on the right <note place="margin">Children not to be carryed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bowed either ſtraight or crooked.</p>
               <p>Therefore let children be changed from one ſide to the other in the carrying to day on this, and to morrow on that ſide, and not ſtill on one alone.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:106818:186"/>
               <p> Some Mothers have the cuſtome, that they place their <note place="margin">To govern children in their ſitting.</note> children by times in a ſtool, purpoſely made. Others let their child ſit in the elders childs lap. Others place their child with clouts into a tub. Be it in what manner it will, I adviſe no body to uſe his child too ſoon to ſitting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the childs body above is heavier than his neither part, and all the weight of it lyeth on his back. Some children are weaker in their backs and ſinewes than others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t adviſeable to place children too ſoon into ſtooles, or other ſitting places. To ſet it upright in the cradle, and to ſtay his back withal, or to place it on a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low near the harth or chimney, is the better way. The longer you ſtay with the child in that kind, the better ſtrength it gets, even in ſitting before another child. As we ſee a twigg inoculated this year, groweth as faſt as that which was ingrafted the other year before that. The ſame condition it hath with a child, his back groweth ſtrong in that time, and the leſs danger is it ſubject unto, which if too ſoon uſed to ſitting, parents muſt ſtill be affraid that it will take hurt. Though a child is able to ſit, yet for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, it is naught for it, to have it ſit long.</p>
               <p>Therefore as I mentioned above, the child is to be laid on the back, and let it lye ſo untyed or bound playing; this way is beſt for ſuch children, which are not agazed at their feet and hands, when they thus play on their back; but if they be ſo young, that their own feet or hands may terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, then they ought not to be laid unbound or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſtanding of children, there are ſtools for children to ſtand in, in which they can turn round any way, <note place="margin">The ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> when Mothers or Nurſes ſee them in it, then they care no more for the child, let it alone, go about their own buſineſs, ſuppoſing the child to be well provided, but they little think on the pain and miſerie the poor child is in, in that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Take an example from an aged man, which ſtandeth but an hour in a place, either in the pulpit or elſe where, that time ſeems long to them; what ſhall we think of the poor child, which muſt ſtand may be many hours, whereas half an
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:106818:186"/> hour ſtanding is too long for ſuch a child. I wiſh that all ſuch ſtanding ſtools were burn'd, and that never any were made, by reaſon of the great miſery that Children endure from ſuch ſtanding: for I hold theſe ſtools a meer priſon, or ſtocks for poor Infants; I do wonder many times, what mercileſs fool that was, who invented that rack at firſt, to make a Child ſtand above an hour in that tub. I found many times, that when ſuch Children overſtood themſelves in <note place="margin">Children are hurt in ſtanding too long in their ſtool.</note> that tub, ſunck down where they lay a long time, and there they loſt their ſtrength, which were brought to me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to recover and cure them: Children ſhould not be made ſtand on their feet, before they are half a years old, and be ſtrong enough in their ſinewes; and coming from ſuch a cure, they muſt reſt half a year, then they grow ſtrong again, and Nature will be aiding unto them, neither is there any medicine to be uſed, onely they muſt be kept warm and quiet. I made uſe ſometimes of Oxycroceum Plaiſter, and three moneths after I made a warm Bath, put them in, thereby I recovered them to their full ſtrength. Children that are forced to ſuch ſtanding, commonly grow lame, and limp on both ſides. I never ſaw any good done, when children were taught to ſtand or to go, before they had any ſufficient ſtrength to it: my adviſe is, not to put Children to ſoon upon ſtanding, but if Nature be forward in them, then they may venture the ſooner.</p>
               <p>There are running ſtools for Children made, in which <note place="margin">Childrens running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.</note> they do not onely ſtand, but go alſo; in theſe ſtools the Children can hold out longer, becauſe they can ſtir and move in them.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſpeak alſo a word or two about the covering of childrens faces to keep off the flies from them. Some lay a white cloth over them; others doubles ſuch clothes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtifle the child under it, which in my opinion is an ill cuſtome; Others ſet bowes over the cradle and <note place="margin">Bowes</note> hang clothes over them, which I hold to be good, becauſe the children are not touched by the clothes that are hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged over, neither can they well be frightneh by them: theſe pleaſe me the better, if the clothes hanged over are
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:106818:187"/> ſo thin, that the chilrens breath can have way to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and if ſuch clothes be either of a blew or green dye, they are the better for their eye ſight: pure Scrafes or Tif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finies are good for that purpoſe.</p>
